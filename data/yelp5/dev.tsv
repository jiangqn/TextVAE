omg . the short ribs are fantastic . every time i come here , i always have the short ribs or the tacos . when you walk in the front door , be sure to grab yourself a freshly baked cookie .	3
had the crab wontons and a chuck <unk> roll . crab wonton were ok . skimpy on the fillings . nothing special . chuck <unk> would be disapointed with his name on the roll . it was n't kick a $ $ . the food was ok . nothing exciting	2

stars are for the food ! it gets a bit backed up during the lunch rush and i could see how it would effect someones rating . i can also see how people would either love this place or not like it at all because it is a bit unique	3

good food , good cocktails but no happy hour ! i would definitely recommend hanny 's as a lunch spot for downtown workers , but not sure i would make a special trip to get there . they have a large space , so it 's great for large parties	2

great little -lrb- maybe i should say really little -rrb- irish pub with great food . if you are a jameson irish whiskey fan like me , this is the place . they serve 18 year old jameson and it is amazing . the fish and chips are really good	3

what i value about hana has as much to do with what it 's not as with what it is . it 's not a concept . there arent any <unk> or <unk> <unk> or aquariums flown in from hawaii . just quality fish prepared and served by what looks	3
i guess malee 's has been around 25 years , but it seems like fifty , and i mean that in a good way . the restaurant is both venerable and hip enough to comfortably pass as scottsdale `` special occasion '' - without breaking the bank . is it	3
atmosphere inside is kinda like a mexican version of chompies - good sized counter restaurant <unk> by market and bakery , oozing ethnic energy . more intimate -lrb- and less overwhelming -rrb- than ranch market ; a plus for tentative gringos like me . it 's a lengthy and fun	2
there 's nothing the least bit elegant about pat 's and it wont be your aunt <unk> 's cup o ' tea , but newer restaurants selling <unk> , faux authenticity look positively silly next to this guy . it 's a gritty , cramped throwback more than a <unk>	3

the noodles here are so good ! i love their pot stickers . they have the perfect ratio of meat to noodle and they have a really good sauce as well . i also ordered the xo spicy noodles . the noodles were great , but the meat was not	3
i really do n't like amc very much . i prefer harkins and even cinemark to amc . so i went and saw a movie here yesterday with my mom and sister in law and it was fine , the movie was good . that really has nothing to do	1
the bf decided to take me on a date tonight -lrb- woot ! -rrb- , and we chose to try this place . i 'm really glad we did ! the place is cute , despite being in a strip mall with a dollar theatre . we had to wait	3
chase field is a decent ballpark . i like going here to see baseball games -lrb- obviously -rrb- , and most of the seats are good . the food selection is not great and is overpriced , as is pretty par for baseball fields everywhere , but if you are	3
i have been to this red devil location a few times and it has been fairly good each time . they have decent pizza , and -lrb- imo -rrb- good bruschetta , because they put the tomatoes and whatnot on garlic bread ... yum . also , they give you	2
ok ... so i have been back a few times and i have a serious problem with this place . they will not make my food spicy . for real . i order hot and the food is bland and lacking any sort of spice ... it makes no sense	1
this place redeemed itself ! i went here with my family for my birthday a few weeks ago -lrb- why go to a 3 star place for your birthday ... i do n't know , convenience ? -rrb- . anyway , i got to try many more items due to	3
i went here for lunch today as i had a groupon and had been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile . people are n't lying when they say the place runs slow ... we were there for at least an hour at lunch time with only 2-3 tables occupied	2

i just picked up some pho ga from pallets for dinner tonight . i called , ordered it to go , and it was ready about 15 minutes later ... perfect ! they pack the pho up nicely in 3 separate packages , <unk> , noodles , and toppings -lrb-	3
this pizza is great , i just wish they were open more often . i have only had their pizza once , but have tried to have their pizza 4 times . they are closed at -lrb- my -rrb- dinner time , and i keep forgetting -lrb- silly me -rrb-	4

the bf and i went here tonight because we were going to a movie and did n't feel like mexican food -lrb- which is too bad because abuelos would have been much much better -rrb- . we wanted a lighter dinner . so he had the bbq chicken salad with	1

i have been here twice and i am not sure if i will be back for a third . the idea is great , it 's nice to have the option to play games and whatnot , but the place is just too busy ... maybe they should let less	1
this is a somewhat fast-food style greek and mediterranean restaurant , but the food quality is top-notch . we 've been coming here for years and find the food quality is very consistent , always great , and the portions are very generous . entree prices range from $ 7	4
this place is ok , but we probably would n't go back . the good part is the nice selection of draft beers , and good friendly service . however neither of us were impressed with our meals . i had a house burger , which was rather thin ,	1
it 's a chipotle . that means its consistent , you know what you 're getting , and it 's always fast . if you have n't been to one before and you like fresh mexican-style food , you have to try it . choose your ingredients so you get	3
neat little place with a unique and tasty house sandwich called the suicide 6 . friendly service and food was done quickly .	3
we went there for lunch last week ... and we went very early by my standards - 11:15 am . <unk> minutes later , the place was jammed , and this was on a tuesday . i ordered the mexican pizza and the other person i was with ordered their	2
my food was tasty enough , especially the shrimp taco . as others have commented on , they charge extra for everything . really , do they need to charge extra for cheese on a taco ? the portions were pretty small also . i was done with lunch in	2

i do n't get to the <unk> often enough , so this place is a bit o ' for me : just enough $ $ spent on keeping the <unk> from shutting the place down , the rest of the <unk> <unk> goes into the owners ' pockets . i	4
food 's mediocre for dinner . i kind of enjoyed doing dim sum here though . my man is an abc -lrb- american born chinese -rrb- and he thought the food was meh .	1
a unique burger joint with a humorous experience . did n't go for the food , went for the experience . i walked in and grabbed a seat at the bar . the friendly head <unk> gives you a <unk> <unk> and dresses you in a hospital gown . there	2

i am ashamed . i have not been eating here when i have easy access to it . i remember when i finally went in there this past saturday , that i had stopped by this place when i first moved to arizona and really wanted a <unk> i think	3

i am changing my review to 5 stars . i was back in last night to buy a couple whole rainbow trout to throw on the grill . this place is the best for fresh seafood . i also think it is rad that they offer `` courtesy ice ''	4
i was really excited to try this place . it smelled unbelievably good in here like really good barbeque or bacon or something like that . it was all we could do to sit patiently while our table was set up . unfortunately that is where the visit turned for	0
sushi ... fast food style . basically a step above the sushi at fry 's but good if you want a quick , cheap meal .	2

best time to go is for happy hour . they have great food and drink specials during happy hour although it gets fairly filled up quick . if you go on a friday you will have to get there somewhat early . the patio is nice to people watch since	3
brio has a great happy hour . it is only valid in the bar and patio area , but the weather is perfect to sit outside right now and it makes for great people watching . you ca n't go wrong with the tuscan tasters for $ 3.95 each .	4
i grew up in kentucky and had never heard of five guys . all my friends here were soooo excited when they saw the `` coming soon '' sign on mill ave. so , as a serious burger lover , i got my hopes up and couldnt wait to check	2
a typical trade in store , although bigger than most ive been to . i like this one better than their other locations mostly because the college kids tend to stay out of it so there 's actually stuff worth buying by the time i roll out of bed .	3
this is a `` go to '' spot for us . always . i have never , ever had one complaint about an experience or the food and i have had the pleasure of coming here for 5 + years regularly -lrb- weekly ? -rrb- . great for lunch ,	4
here 's the deal - as far as food goes , this place deserves 5 stars , its inventive , fresh , mexican food and always amazing . the location is great and i would love to frequent it . however , the owner <unk> <unk> always comes off as	1

salt and pepper wings are f 'n amazing . mahi fish tacos for $ 2 on tuesday 's are one of the best deals in scottsdale period . the mexican food was enjoyable as well but i come here for the wings and the tacos .	3
lowest prices on everything . period . i save an average of 5-10 dollars a bottle compared to other stores . excellent selection	4
honestly , i have n't been to the new location yet but am looking forward to it since the last one was a little over crowded and hectic on the weekends , but the food made it worth it . the quality of the food is great and gives you	3
thus far the best thai food i have come across here in arizona . i have now visited a few times and have enjoyed the chicken panang curry , tom kha soup , and drunken noodles with tofu . i have found the `` spiciness '' scale to be accurate	3

cafe zu zu has been a decent place for larger groups . most times the service has been spot on but the last time i was there -lrb- 2 weeks ago -rrb- the service was slow . we were sitting outside and the inside looked pretty dead . i think	2

always consistently good . this last visit i had the thai steak and noodle salad . i think it 's my new favorite !	3
slow <unk> ? ate here three times . sampled a couple interesting beers in the bottle . a couple appetizers and desserts . over priced for what you get but i expected that . that 's par for most of the places feeding off the resort . the last time	0
i happened on this place on a sunday afternoon . they had an irish music jam session going and some of the patrons were dancing a <unk> . honest ! good tap beer selection . good fish n chips , good service . unbelievably good atmosphere when the jam session	2
ate dinner here for the first time a couple of days ago . combo dinner w / green chilli . no draft mex beers . ok food just not the kind of mexican food i like . i like my corn chips covered with salt , hot and greasy ,	1
really , it 's a 2.5 but i 'll bump it up to three for the roasted beet and goat cheese salad which was very good and the white sangria . it 's just an overpriced cheesecake factory without the cheesecake . i went in on a friday late evening	2
this was my first taste of vietnamese and this was a <unk> introduction to the cuisine . the decor is very modern and classy without feeling cold or unfriendly . i did like that there seemed to be a lot of regulars in the place which <unk> well , to	3
bathroom doors are fixed ! <unk> -lrb- i probably just <unk> her poor name -rrb- has now been our server twice and she is excellent ! we had bottle service on saturday for a birthday party and she was great , attentive and made sure no one was ever thirsty	4
we stopped in here after dinner in the area . even though we 'd already eaten , i always like to look at menus to see if it 's a place worth coming to for food . their menu looked excellent with some very unique takes on typical bar food	3
very , very good . service both at the bar and table was impeccable . our server knew the menu very well and made excellent suggestions . their unique cocktails were excellent and a decent price for a decent pour . we enjoyed the <unk> board to start and then	3
has a lovely decore and ambiance . we had questions about wine and we were helped by a wine expert , who nailed what we were looking for on the first try . food was pretty good , i had the sea bass - i loved the brussel sprouts with	3
i love this place 's prices - and usually their wide variety - can not be beat . but 2x now i 've discovered ants in my home shortly after shopping there thanks to produce left on the counter . and i hate ants . so i 'm just going	2
i like this spot ! i 've been to dilly dally twice and each time i 've had a good time . this is a place you go when you just want to grab a beer , maybe watch or play some shuffleboard , and shoot the breeze while listening	3
*** i gave this 5 stars based on the best mexican food i 've had in az , not based on white linen and waiter service , just an fyi *** i wo n't write too much as it seems that everyone already has . both locations are great .	4
kobe hamburger with pretzel bread . that 's all you need to know ! yeah , i 'm a fan ! i visited daily dose on whiskey wednesday . that means $ 5 whiskeys . after one of those , i just had to eat something ! well , hello	3
have you ever walked into a place and said to yourself `` oh ... i 'm going to have a lot of fun here ! '' it happened to me on saturday night . i <unk> into char 's buzzing off of patron and was immediately hit by a dose	3
i love , love scramble ! i do n't know what it is about the place ! is it the sleek and simple decor ? hmm , is it the friendly , attentive service ? is it the <unk> yum food ? perhaps all of the above make me a	3
i 'm officially in love with sol y sombra . i was n't sure if i had room in my heart to love another tapas place , but turns out i 'm shameless and can love many at one time . my visit to sol y sombra was on a	3
i love going to amsterdam to mingle with my lovely gays and dance my booty off . i really like the way this place is decorated . the drinks are slightly pricey but worth it . i do n't think i 've had a bad pour there . i wo	3
mmmm ... thai lahna . thai lahna is the person you spy from across the room that you 're not too sure about but then after talking to them you find out that they 're pretty damn cool . yeah , that 's my thai lahna . my group walked	3
mmm ... pita jungle . i had been craving it all week and finally my lunch buddies decided they wanted to go . this location is busy at lunch time ; full of corporate type as well as families with children -lrb- bad idea to bring kids at lunchtime ,	3
did arcadia tavern for lunch and discovered a fantastic spot ! sports bar meets applebees . the burgers are definitely worth the trip ! complementary valet , mouth watering menu , and great genuine service , love this chill spot , i 'm a new fan ! : -rrb-	3
so after checking this place out i 've decided it three stars . -lrb- ahh , please do n't come after me !! lol -rrb- . i think it 's pretty cute and the coffee is delicious , however with all the other little coffee joints around cenpho , it	2
the mexican food gods and <unk> have possessed the <unk> bodies of the people who work in the los reyes de la torta kitchen to grace us with their magical food . i swear every time i eat here i am transported to another realm of taste bud <unk> .	4
ugh . . myst is basically just myst . it 's really nice inside , especially on the ballroom side , however this place is douche wannabe central . half of the guys here look like they rolled up alone and give off uber creepy vibe . the main dance	1
wow , looks like this makes review # 700 for postino 's ! i 'm sure by now you all have heard of the great monday night deal which includes a bottle of wine and their yummy bruschetta , and it does n't really matter what kind of bruschetta you	3
if pigging out at casino buffets is wrong , i do n't wan na be right . my favorite casino in the area , there is a really good buffet called wandering horse , a swanky lil piano bar , and of course , the pool club . fun for	3
stellar <unk> . this place has everything i look for in a club . great service , good management , great drinks , great crowd , sexy ambiance , dance floor that 's not overly crowded & clean bathrooms . ; -rrb- the music was a lil old school but	4
one of the good things about living in n phoenix is being close to <unk> . lol - -lrb- half kidding -rrb- it 's huge . so many options for dinner . my usual spots for hh or dinner are sandbar and the keg . other usual spots are target	3
i love <unk> ! its like the `` cheers '' of scottsdale , but everybody does n't know my name there yet . got ta try the <unk> . great place for happy hour , and to watch a game . can get crowded , hard to find a seat	3
you know how some people say that those little mom & pops `` hole-in-the-wall '' restaurants make the best food ? well , this is that place . seriously , words ca n't express how much i love pupusas , and choices are limited here in phoenix , but this	4
good location , nice setup , but was n't super impressed with the food . excellent service and the mechanical bull was calling my name ... but think i 'll save my <unk> for next time , after a few jack n cokes !	2
very average place . its part of hyatt hotel , and totally looks like a hotel bar/restaurant . if your in the area , and your starving , or if your staying in the hotel , it will do . service was not very friendly , overall very `` meh	2
one of my favorite breakfast places . heads up , to prevent sticker shock on your check ... expect $ 20 per person . some people do n't think that you should have to pay $ 20 for breakfast . then again , this is n't denny 's . the	3
the location really hurts this theater -lrb- being in a mall -rrb- . 2 things will be guaranteed with this experience : crowds and kids . things that can ruin any <unk> experience . additional tip : assuming it 's because of the mall location , but this harkins theater	0
i 've been here for lunch twice . i 'll be back ! for some reason , and i have no clue why , there are n't many great options for asian buffets here in scottsdale . this place works for me . great variety , traditional dishes , very	3
i used to love this place when it first opened . it was a great afternoon hangout with friends . they had great happy hour pricing , and great music -lrb- especially the old <unk> videos showing on the tv 's -rrb- . the food was really good as well	0
so ... full ... the portions are great , the rolls are even better ... ca n't stop coming to this place ... try the meatloaf ! and btw - do n't be afraid of the veggie skewers ... they are awesome !	3
it only loses a star for always being way too crowded . i know , that 's a crappy way to lose a star , but if i ca n't park and always have to wait in line you do n't get 5 stars !	3
a breakfast menu that breaks away from the ordinary and trite dishes to give your taste buds a small adventure . we all enjoyed our meals thoroughly but one guy with us was upset that his butter was n't soft enough . i feel his pain , but that 's	3

for as much hype as this place got from my friends i was expecting some sort of flavor explosion to occur when i ate here . instead what i got was a wait in a place with limited ac in az in the <unk> for what was essentially a ton	2

usually come here on friday nights with my friends who are regulars . food is pretty solid the lamb meatballs and johnny 's nachos are very popular with our group . even their ranch dressing is really good and i am not a big ranch fan . i also like	3
i have a love hate relationship with hob nobs . let 's start with the love . it 's within walking distance from my house , which is super convenient . secondly , this place is adorable . it 's located in a lovingly restored historic home , and there	2

it 's expensive . it 's smaller than most aj 's . but guess what ? there 's not many places like this in central phoenix . it 's hard to get quality cuts of meat , great veggies and over-priced flowers any closer to downtown , so i 'll	2

after my third trip to <unk> wong , i thought it was time to write the raving review it so obviously deserves , even despite the fact that they do not serve alcohol ! hot pot is basically fondue with a soup broth instead of cheese . it is an	4
overrated . the treats are tasty but certainly not the best i have ever had . i would have rated this a two star but the cakes and cookies are really pretty . the design makes up for the lack of taste . over priced too . fortunately for them	2
the <unk> sandwich is amazing . they have a very limited menu , but once you try the food , you will eat there regularly . all outdoor seating , and they have limited hours , so make sure you check the hours before you head out there .	3
zen32 is my favorite place to get sushi . i have been here at least a dozen times over the years and have never had an <unk> experience . i am not the best sushi critic being that i am vegetarian , but i think they have pretty good veggie	3

since the place is right in my new ` hood , i had to check it out . it seemed slow for a saturday night -- we were seated right away in a mostly empty dining room . usually a red flag for me , but times are tough .	2
unimpressed , sadly . we stopped in for a nightcap on a friday night and it was fairly busy . everyone was <unk> in front around the live music , and there were empty seats in the back and up in the balcony . we tried up there first ,	1

i have n't eaten a meal here for a long time , so i 'm reviewing just the nightlife aspect of the place . it is divided roughly into a restaurant on one side and a <unk> music area on the other . the live bands they have in here	3
hey , a restaurant that sells food and brews their own beer . what a novel concept ! not . bj 's is a chain and they do pretty good by their patrons . i can never go to a restaurant that serves fish and chips and not order it	2
i 'm sad to say that the place has gone very much downhill since their move to a bigger location . i 've given them a few chances hoping it was just growing pains , but it 's taken way too long to get back on their game . i	1
a couple of things stuck out to me for this place . one was the really clean and refreshing ambience they 've got going on . the other thing that stuck out was the <unk> , yet <unk> of the food . i had a turkey and egg sandwich ,	3

best house margarita in phoenix . their ingredients are standard , but something makes them tangy and i ca n't figure it out to duplicate at home . keeps me coming back i guess . we 'd be back more if they offered better vegetarian selections ...	3
always great . always hip . moscow mule is my favorite drink and my girl likes the caramel apple martini -- always served to the brim . hell 's fire chips are fantastic too , with extra az <unk> sauce .	4
as mayor on <unk> , i 'm obligated to review this place . favorite is the veggie <unk> burrito . i add pico and green salsa and salt to the inside though , as i think they 're salsas are bland .	3
meh . while they serve a decent house margarita , their service is spotty and the food , kind of bland . i 'll recommend it as a good place to go to meet someone at the <unk> bar for chips , salsa and margaritas . that 's it .	2

this place reminded us of our trip to ireland recently ! the atmosphere -lrb- minus the big screen tvs -rrb- was very much like irish <unk> . the food was very good as well , and the service was very quick . we 'd definitely return !	3
good food and fast service . the prices were good too ! i love orzo ! : -rrb-	3
very strenuous hike at times , but that gives you that sense of accomplishment ! it 's so cool to make it all the way to the top and look down on the whole city . beautiful views !	4
we liked crush lounge better than christopher 's . i guess that means we liked the smaller plates and appetizers better than the entrees . and it 's a little pricey if you just kind of like the food . probably not going to return .	2
very good food ! we ate some shrimp tacos and macaroni and cheese . they split our tacos up for us and did n't charge for it ... the portions were great too ! our server was friendly as well . would definitely return !	3
love the raised garden as you walk into this place . it 's so wonderful to see the food you will be eating ! everything looked so great . we had the make your own pizza <unk> and grilled veggies . pretty good ! very good for the price too	3

everything is genetically modified food on purpose - not real sure what all the fuss is about this place . it is an average place . nothing stood out except that they purposely use genetically modified ingredients , they never use anything organic on purpose . everything you eat in	0

the food was sooo good ! you can not miss out on eating at this place . there was never a dull moment . the drinks were great too !	4
i do n't get what the hype and big deal are . i do think the outdoor patio seating is quaint . i love that they give pizza dough to the kids to play with and then bake the kids creation . i found our salad to be just okay	2
totally bummed that when i ordered tofu and veggies it came out cooked in chicken broth . i 'm sure it is my fault and i should have <unk> that i was a vegetarian but i thought that was <unk> from the conversation i had with the waitress and by	0
this place is packed on a friday night ! the service is so so so slow . the food on the menu is interesting - soft pretzels with mustard and so on . my drink was good and i enjoyed the outside bar .	3
pretty good service though our waiter did forget to give us breadsticks . i like that they give you a free sampling of wine before your dinner . love the zuppa <unk> soup and the salad . the eggplant parm was just so so .	3
i am so glad that the entertainment book had a coupon for this place . a girlfriend of mine and i went for dinner and i just loved it . i can not wait to go back . we got a vegetarian sampler plate and the waiter -lrb- owner maybe	4
went for my son 's 15th birthday to enjoy lunch . sushi is his favorite . this place is small and you have to go into the restaurant next door for the restroom . the menu is fairly limited and expensive , in my opinion . the service was average	1

went for lunch with my husband . i had the tofu asian vegetable salad . it was just okay . the salad was fairly expensive - over $ 11 . it was pretty small . i was laughing about it having the word vegetable in it because it contained lettuce	2
positives : + outdoor <unk> + cheese and fruit plate + pork entree negatives : - tight trendy inside of restaurant - average salads - bad parking situation	2
i was just not that impressed with the sandwiches . i would rather buy the baguette they make there -lrb- the kids enjoy watching that -rrb- and make my own sandwiches at home .	2
just did take out . great experience . easy to place my order over the phone , friendly service . nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance . made it an in and out operation . ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage .	4
i wo n't hurry back . i did enjoy the amount of avocado they put on my veggie burger . the sweet potato fries were okay . the line was a bit long and the food a bit over priced .	2
good . not bad . not great . tastes just like a fry bread that you get at any casino or street fair , ect . i had the indian taco with beans , cheese and lettuce . my three kids split two of the tacos with ground beef ,	2
had to wait a little for a table . the first time we were seated was right by the open kitchen . it was so loud that we asked to be moved . we had to wait again for a new table . the waiter was n't overly friendly or	3

when i go here i always look forward to when i can go back . i enjoy the bread bowls of soup , the sandwiches , the pasta - butternut squash and garlic lemon penne are my favorites . i also like the new flavored lemonade they have and the	4
okay , i like the fact that your meal comes with a drink -lrb- milk , coffee or tea -rrb- and salad or soup and bread and dessert . or if you want to skip the drink and dessert at lunch it is $ 1.50 off your bill . i	3
i went in with really low expectations as this is a chain restaurant and left very happy . the ambiance is higher scale then i expected and the service was very good . they offer both low cost and higher end priced meals on the menu . i went with	3
i visited this location a few months ago for the first time , and returned for my second visit the very next day . i got their standard chicken and waffle plate on my first visit , and just chicken and macaroni the next day . both visits were pleasant	3
they have good lunch specials , but your options are more limited than at dinner time . i have had the pleasure of trying almost everything on their menu , as i have been going here for years . good quality , huge portions , but the servers can make	3

i do n't care a whole lot for this mall , but they have a good <unk> 's of hollywood , so that 's a plus for me . it 's pretty ghetto here , despite the fancy facade they so desperately try to put out there . they have	2
i was pleasantly surprised with this place ! kierland is really uppity in my mind , so i tend to shy away from all their dining options . too fancy schmancy for me ! however , after a long day of shopping and browsing the crazy ridiculous sur la table	3
this place really made me laugh , but mostly because of the <unk> hanging from the ceiling . he has a big happy face along with arms and legs . how cool is that ? to say this place is bustling would be a serious understatement . every single time	3
typically the husband and i do n't care for harkins theatres for a myriad of reasons , but this one seemed to be a step above all the other locations . first of all , they seemed to be well staffed , and their employees actually did their jobs well	3
i really liked this place ! walking inside to this sleek and beautifully appointed <unk> restaurant is a stark contrast to the <unk> strip mall complex that it calls home . clean white walls surround the modern chairs and deep benches with dark wood accents . i love the splash	3
this may be my new favorite spring training facility ! i 've been to every one in the cactus league except for the one in <unk> , but that 's coming soon . this park is absolutely gorgeous . everything from the rolling hills to the carefully crafted winding paths	4

i am definitely going to miss this place now that we live in seattle . we seem to have a hard time finding non <unk> healthy food dining options here . aside from that , this place is really quite good . basically , everything on this menu is healthy	3
i 'm not going to really <unk> into what makes bianco 's pizza world famous , because i do n't agree . it is certainly delicious pizza , no doubt . to be honest though , you can get the same quality pizza at cibo 's in a tiny fraction	2

if you know what you want and you 're prepared , fogo de chao is 5 stars . practically starved myself all day so i could indulge . father-in-law and i were greeted warmly by the hostess . stopped in the bar for a drink and had a nice glass	4
i love everything chef jose garces touches . have been here 3 times , and every time has been a little different , but always excellent . went for a menu tasting with a magazine writer who was doing a feature , so we got to try lots of dishes	4
5 star pancakes , 3 star service and facilities . the pancakes are perfect . super light and fluffy . a `` short stack '' -lrb- two big pancakes -rrb- is perfect for a normal human being . service is just so-so -- nice enough , but <unk> . and	3

honey bears offers a different type of bbq sauce , it 's the <unk> kind that also packs more of a kick . i personally prefer a thicker sauce but this one is still tasty . they keep some warm out in the open for you to help yourself which	2
good consistent bbq . the portions are hefty and the prices seem reasonable . i really like that they have so many sauces to choose from and that they have paper towels at the tables . not much more to say , i mean , it 's a chain but	2

i really do enjoy famous daves . we usually get the family of 4 deal and that offers almost every single meat they offer . something for everyone . the service is good , the food is good and everyone is happy !	3
jam packed well after lunch hours . full of mostly locals - hawaiian locals that is . -lrb- that right there should tell you something . -rrb- i have not had island food this good since i left the islands . i am serious - there is a place in	4
i really wanted to like this place more because of the nice beer selection they have . downside is that it has kind of a low life neighborhood sports bar type of atmosphere inside . food choices were heavily <unk> on grease also . not that healthy and the bartender	2
i am not much of a sushi fan usually but i thought this place was pretty good . i was really happy that they had more than the typical sapporo , <unk> , kirin beers that you find at every sushi place but had a small number of american microbrew	2
when we got there the place was crowded so we decided to go out on the patio . alright , who <unk> a lot of money on a patio and does n't install lights ? service was super slow outside and because we could n't read the menus we made	1
pretty darn good burger and sides . still not as good as in n out but few places are . love the sweet potato fries and chocolate malt . i wish they had more options as to fixings but it was still ok and i will go back .	3
a cool coffee shop with beer , what could be better ? well how about serving beer past 10:00 on a saturday ? totally stupid operating hours for the bar . reminds me of of more like a dorm room than a place to go hang out in .	1
updated to 3 stars simply based off the great response i got from the founder of the company in response to my yelp review .	2
the gelato is top notch . really great flavors . maybe i just had bad luck with the server but she did n't know how to make a malt , she even said that she thought a malt and a shake were the same thing and i had to tell	3

while slightly overpriced on many items such as yogurt , milk and produce , the deli sandwich prices ca n't be beat . the store is always clean and the food always appears fresh .	3
love this place , major problem is that there is always a wait on the weekend and no reservations . my other knock is that they have some crazy <unk> some items are certainly reasonable such as a side pork chop for $ <unk> how can you justify $ 4.00	3
if you are looking for an old fashioned ice cream parlor this is the spot . the food is also old school diner type food , the meatloaf is pretty good , but it is meatloaf after all , not a porterhouse steak . the desserts are rich and the	3

i 'm not sure why asu has n't started using this place for research yet . <unk> could study human <unk> patterns in the shoe section . <unk> could study class <unk> between the <unk> buying 15 designer handbags and the college girls buying 6 $ 1.00 tank tops .	3
pullano 's is a dirty little sports bar located in a run down strip mall . but , remember , looks can be deceiving . the pizza and wings are some of the best on the westside as well as some of the cheapest . but what really matters is	2
fresh and easy makes for an interesting study in <unk> . when i am at home in san diego , i do not shop fresh and easy because the location nearest to me is not on any of my regular paths . tempe fresh and easy is smack dab in	2
we got to experience macayo 's because the local italian restaurant is closed on sundays . how to express the feel ... ? not very busy on a sunday afternoon around 4 pm ... overpriced and certainly <unk> margaritas ... plenty of chips and salsa being delivered to the table	1
great brisket and smoked salmon , the fish <unk> was n't bad either and calamari was tasty but it is pick and choose . the pizza did not look good but many items were fresh . for the price of nearly $ 25 per person -lrb- incl tax -rrb- that	2
yelp deal of 50 % off was great !	3
a little bit difficult to find and an off beat menu pairing but it was good . -lrb- note : despite the yelp map showing it on the e side of central , lo-lo 's is actually west of central two doors on the north side of <unk> -rrb- .	3
free tasting of <unk> tequila at the entrance . thanks for the introduction , it was pretty smooth . btw , does anyone recall the song <unk> ? the name is too close - lol !	3

need to update my review : i went back to distrito twice this week . once , while attending the taste of scottsdale food tour . i was impressed this time around ! on the food tour we had guac and chips . both were home made and delish !	4
a patio that does n't just make you look at cars ! that 's the first thing you 'll notice when you get here . on a weekend you can wait about 45 minutes , but just get a designer margarita and enjoy the view and the action . fyi	3
they 're smart about their wine list and serve a good cocktail . i think that 's a great place to start . i 've been here several times and the last time was when they offered a <unk> menu with justin wine pairings . they created a great atmosphere	3
this is as good as it gets . the sensory and educational exhibits are well organized and thought out . i suggest going to the web site to check out value packs and group rates for admission . as of june 08 , food selection is only snacks -lrb- chips	4

this place is absolutely awesome ! i loved the pretzel bread and the pizza , can not wait to try more of the other pizzas . the beer queso was terrific with the pretzel bread and pizza crust . : -rrb-	4
this is one of my favorite breakfast places of all time . the strawberry cheesecake french toast is my favorite along with the berry pancakes or french toast both are good . i tried the corned beef hash skillet and it was okay . the waiter is hit or miss	4
once again i have found an all time favorite dish at this fine establishment . the house chicken ! if you do not like mushrooms what so ever or do not care for spicy food i do not think this will appeal to you . oh my god it is	4
i have never had hand pulled noodles before so i ordered it in both the beef stew soup i ordered which was okay . also in the fried chicken noodles i had ordered . the noodles were tasty but i suggest cutting them a bit so its a little easier	2

well , you know what they say - when a place is always busy , there is usually a reason . i have gone into <unk> several times and could not find a place to sit at there huge bar - why ? because the food is fantastic and everyone	4
the only place i 've been able to find deep eddy sweet tea vodka and i 'm surely going back for the wine !	3
torched goodness is a special treat ! i have seen them twice at the <unk> farmers market . creme brulee is my favorite dessert and they do it right !	4
we have a new sushi spot . probably the best sushi i 've had in 10 years . i recommend the surf n turf roll !	4
local , fresh , az treasure . next time i want a milkshake , and at least two people to share it with .	4
portillo 's in chicago is a must . portillo 's in arizona , meh . scottsdale location better than tempe location , and i only say this because you can taste that lovely tempe <unk> water taste in the food .	1
aside from our grumpy waitress who sucked at her job , everyone was friendly and helpful . the cinnamon roll was great , like a homemade <unk> . omelette and scramble pairings were very creative . the toast was weird enough that i 'd ask for an alternative next time	3
it has been about a year since our last visit and we had definitely been looking forward to it . while we enjoyed our last stay , the room we stayed in was showing its age and use . to be expected though for a hotel that seems to be	4

visited here recently on a late saturday afternoon before dinner , this is in the downtown sheraton , great location . . hotel is beautiful . . the bar was busy even for a late afternoon , nice wine list and appetizer was good ... would definitely come back !	3
enjoyed lunch here recently , was there early and by 11:45 the place was packed . food was great , especially the tortilla soup that they serve on thursdays . a bit pricey for lunch -lrb- $ 40 tab for 2 -rrb- but well worth it . they have an	3
sky harbor is a nice airport . decent staff , good layout overall i would recommend .	2
zipps is a local favorite and honestly has the best wings i have ever had . between their 32 ounce beers , medium golden honey wings and happy hour specials this is the place to be for sports events . it does get packed quickly and the tv selection is	3

i loved stopping in to lola tapas for coffee in the morning , and since they 've moved over to central - closer to me - yay - it 's even better . i 've always liked lola coffee in one sense better than lux because it 's a calmer	4
walking distance from work , i love this place ! been there many , many times for lunch in , lunch to go , happy hour , brunch on sundays , some wine on a lazy afternoon ... and one thing this place has in common for all of those	3
good idea for a date night , but not executed well . we went in with a groupon for 2 wine tasting flights and an appetizer . we ordered a `` <unk> brownie . '' i do n't know if you have ever had these before , but they are	1
at one time i thought ticoz was a solid 4 stars , but recently it has gone downhill . whenever i go to lunch in this area every restaurant is packed , except ticoz . this should have been my first clue to stop going here . however , they	2
i love that they have a `` different '' menu . lots of unique choices - all good ! my usual go to is the chopped salad with the lox and couscous . it is definitely my favorite , but everything here is good ! try something you normally would	3
i saw a groupon for cove trattoria so i decided to give it a try . i had a salmon salad for lunch . i thought it was quite nice . the salmon was flavorful and cooked well and the salad was simple , but nice . the service was	3

i stumbled on to this place by accident and was very pleased that fate brought me here . great atmosphere , friendly staff , and totally had the feel of a neighborhood bar . upon recommendation i tried the deviled eggs which is definitely something i have never seen at	4
a very good sports bar - it is quite amazing just how many flat screen tv 's they can cram on every wall . also i was very impressed with their `` gorilla '' wings - you get 13 for $ 9 and have to say they are some of	4
always a great experience here ! nearly all the staff is knowledgeable about pet food and treats and what is recommended for your breed . we bathe our dogs here regularly and they always leave so soft and fluffy and smelling great . the music and fun , vibrant colors	4
just a heads up , do n't go here with the expectation that you 're getting authentic mexican food . all of us <unk> know that a really great authentic mexican restaurant almost always begins with a mexican woman 's name : -rrb- this place is very good for what	4
three stars sounds about right . my fav is the <unk> <unk> . it has potato , sausage , leeks - super good . on this occasion i tried the featured dish , the chicken marsala -lrb- chicken , mushrooms , side of roasted potatoes and peppers -rrb- . umm	2

this place is as good as it gets ! amazing selection , super helpful staff , and the prices on used books can not be beat . i used to shop at bookmans until i stumbled upon this place , the prices are <unk> % cheaper on used books .	4
we have been coming here since my son was 6 months old -lrb- he is now 21/2 -rrb- this is the one place we can come and i feel 100 % comfortable letting him run around and explore . the entire museum is kid friendly and has something in every	4

totally a fan of this place since before i joined the military in <unk> . we enjoy coming to this place to forget about our diet and it 's one of my favorite `` dive 's '' ever . the jade chicken is the bomb , the hot sauce is	3
i like the cute charming older converted home that houses this restaurant . the style of the food is very different from another vietnamese i tried recently . i ordered the lemongrass chicken . what i liked most about this variation of lemongrass chicken were the beautiful assortment of steamed	2
we came in extra early for dinner on the way to an event . the place was packed and on a wait with mostly sports enthusiast also on the way to an event . that normally is a good sign that things should be running well . i did notice	1
i vowed never to return after my last experience here but was in the area and we were in need of hot cherry peppers and thought defalco 's would have them . i had the half italian beef sandwich , i liked the taste of it with the onions and	2

the exterior of the building might be unappealing but once you step in it 's whimsical and cheerful . this is a family owned <unk> style seafood restaurant that is open every day for lunch and dinner . right away they gave us house made chips , the daily made	3
this weekend i had the market sandwich that was made with very good and not tangy goat cheese , tomato and arugula the price went up to $ 12 -lrb- i think that is allot -rrb- but what bothered me the most was that the bread was different . the	2
pappadeaux is pronounced pappa dough i think of it now as pappa do n't season the food here . i really liked the building inside and out . the patio is charming and the inside looks so old fashioned and established . the wait staff looks professional and the place	1
i 've been here a few times and like many places it 's a little different each time . they always start you with a pretty good bread basket . this time the blue cheese butter was a nice <unk> temperature and you top you bread with that <unk> sauce	2
we pass this place all the time and wanted to try them since they do ok on the maricopa restaurant inspections . this place was very noisy with lots of foreign loud <unk> . the chairs are very uncomfortable but the food we had was good and did differ from	3
i knew that going to a new restaurant on opening day would have some hiccups in service and possibly food preparation . that said we decided to try barrio queen for lunch today . the idea of ordering at the window and having a seat outside was a nice idea	1
an affair not to be missed . besides the amazing participating restaurants of the valley it really was a party as we ran into friends and also great live music such as <unk> <unk> and you could walk around the art museum included . not all but many restaurants had	4
my review is only on the food from just one visit and not on the abundant selection of over thirty craft brews they offer on tap . i also noticed a selection of wines on tap and a very nice large dog friendly patio . i ordered what i think	3
i thought the food might be decent because of the very good yelp rating . my husband started with the minestrone soup . the soup was very thin and watery with a burnt taste . i note this soup did n't have any beans or pasta in it but only	1
i am undecided between four and five stars so i went with five because overall this second very good experience exceeded my expectations . we started our dinner with happy hour prices and got a pretty good bottle of wine half price for almost what it cost you at the	4
short story . a-ok but not very good at price point . i do note we only had lunch and maybe they shine more at dinner time . i also note three stars is still a positive review . long story . this is a pristine clean modern beautiful place	2
dog gone it the meal was <unk> filled with unexpected surprises and masterful execution . it was something to yelp about . you will bark about having a great meal here if you share a bunch of small plates . many of the plates come in small or regular sizes	4
spinach salad with bacon citrus vinaigrette dressing , goat cheese , red onion and house caramelized nuts @ afternoon happy hour prices . cool spot to cool your heels on a hot afternoon on the shaded , <unk> patio or the <unk> cramped wonderfully cool dining room and bar .	4
nothing fancy , but generally filling and not bad . tonight 's arroz con pollo provided a decent , filling , tasty and inexpensive meal . the dining area was -lrb- and is usually -rrb- clean , and the men 's room is adequate , seems sanitary and has always	2
i love coupons . apparently the server at cantina laredo does n't . i presented mine -lrb- free guacamole ! -rrb- and she looked horrified but returned a few minutes later with all the proper ingredients . it was fun to watch the guacamole mashed together right in front of	1

as soon as i stepped out of my car to go into the place , a gentleman who worked there stepped out and was throwing rice on the ground for a huge gathering of <unk> . yeah . kinda annoying while i 'm trying to go inside to eat .	2
after reading all the wonderful reviews of this place , we decided to get a babysitter for the night and plan a date night ... first off , can i just say this is the strangest location of any restaurant that i 've ever been to ? it 's like	1

lobby is sloppy . . in a good way ! i got a double cheeseburger with fries , and it was big , juicy , and hit the spot on my lunch . it was dripping with special sauce and filled up my hands , but gone oh so quickly	4
i was in the mood to stick to a budget on an afternoon full of fun with the kiddo . impossible you say ? not quite . this place was worth the drive up to scottsdale . not bad for the price of admission , it was $ 10 for	4

if you are looking for a place to do tequila shots , this is not the place , as they are stingy with their booze ... that was 100 % sarcasm . the patron shots are literally 3 shots in one . also just recently noticed that they have a	4

wow , i am amazed at how such an amazing , chic , cute , and inviting place like this can be in downtown phoenix , no offense . the phoenix area continues to surprise me with these little gems that are full of delicious food , yummy drinks ,	3
i am impressed with the food and service here . i was initially looking to enjoy some delicious korean food , but the place that i wanted to visit were closed on a sunday . i then opted for vietnamese food . i am rather new to arizona , but	3
okay , so i am rather new to town and have been to very famous and not so famous soul food restaurants around the world , and this one is to me , only decent . i decided to try this restaurant out today after visiting an historical church for	2

the problem with bandera is everyone waits at the bar prior to getting seated . well how is that a problem you might ask since that is normal everywhere else ... the problem is that they order their meal , are <unk> through it and then move to their tables	2

the <unk> you expect . not really anything especially bad or especially nice to say . chips warm and fresh , but salsa was kind of `` <unk> <unk> '' bleh . large portion . great coupon .	2
in short : too chic for its own good , food is ok , ambiance is unique : for good or worse . i went here on a whim because frankly the place looks <unk> cool . the atmosphere is always happening and lots of good looking people just hanging	2
in short : food was tasty but i 've had much better . in the end the experience was a letdown . i really had high hope for stacy 's , after all top ten is top ten . never even heard of this place before that but i i	2

based on my last review , the owner , louis , took the time to address my concern and offer me a gift card . now that is amazing customer service . thank you louis for taking the time .	4
we , three , went to check out the stick that 's been talking and come to find out , it does have a lot to say . we sat in the shadow <unk> it up with some wine , good music , and dancing . it was a mature	4
a great space where you can see a live band or sing karaoke as well as enjoy authentic vietnamese cuisine . owner is passionate about what he is doing and makes sure everyone leaves satisfied . if you have any issue ask for <unk> he will make it right .	3
great local joint to hang out and grab a drink or a bite . excellent food and oysters .	3
family run small business in tempe . everything was tasty but not terribly exciting . very limited options . seems authentic .	2
great prices . my daughter and i ate there for $ 12 and walked out stuffed . it 's definitely not authentic mexican but it is still good . i got the green chili chimichanga and a beef taco . both were fantastic for the money . the only knock	4
food was alright but i thought it was a bit overpriced for fast food mexican that 's really nothing special or unique . me and my wife went there and it was over $ 20 and i was just barely full . it 's a better value to just go	0
i 'll admit it : i 've gotten old . i hate going out on nye . i hate dealing with the drunk masses that inevitably have popped collars and think <unk> blue ribbon is the <unk> . sure , i could solve that problem by going to a friend	4
we found this place while walking in downtown for a first friday event . i immediately loved the decor -lrb- exposed brick , some art on the walls , a really warm feel to it -rrb- and was instantly hooked by the smell wafting out of the front door .	3
** full disclosure ** i only came here for drinks , not the food . a group of us walked into carly 's after our holiday lunch in order to grab some drinks and get our evening started . we were greeted with a look of disgust -lrb- we werent	0

i 've been wanting to try this place for awhile after hearing good things about it and reading the menu . i realize now why the website does n't list prices -- the mission is <unk> overpriced ! we ended up on the patio since they were n't seating in	2
i 've been meaning to try this place since it opened , and i finally got around to it this week . now i 'm mad i waited so long ! i have tried many veggie burgers in my life , and i think i may have found `` the	4

what i love about this place is the selection and the prices . they are cheaper than other stores about 90 % of the time . i love it when their ads have the $ 15 off a $ 100 wine purchase coupons . i have a list organized by	3
based on my first visit , i would have happily given la condesa a 4 star review . my veggie tacos were delicious , and i loved all the fun salsas . i could n't get enough of them ! really , the only negative was the cramped quarters .	1
after dining here almost every day of his <unk> vacation , the rob has decided that it is not a grease that comes off some of the burgers , -lrb- as previously stated -rrb- but a sort of au jus sauce , the contents of which is trying to break	4
let 's deal with the elephant in the room first ... this place is totally in an old fazoli 's . not that there 's anything wrong with that , but it 's the same <unk> as the generic mexican joint housed in what was clearly a pizza hut once	2
took the light rail from downtown to postino 's on a saturday -- felt downright cosmopolitan ! got there just before 4pm , earning me a few bucks off my first glass of wine . the patio was just about full , and within an hour there was a waiting	3
mediocre food the night we went , but it was busy and late so i did n't mind terribly . wine was tasty and reasonably priced , and the place had a fun atmosphere rolling . there was a fire pit and band out back , and <unk> tunes inside	2
it 's a cool little downtown bar , with a bit of a portland or seattle feel to it . dinky house , old dark wood <unk> , neat art on the walls , and for the most part a fun , relaxed clientele . conversations with strangers just seem	3
good selection of non-fat flavors and good selection of toppings .	3
if you 're looking for a great breakfast sandwich , this is the place to go to ! my husband and i have have tried several ones and none have disappointed . each bagel sandwich is about $ 7 - $ 8 but they 're a decent size .	3
great place to people watch -lrb- went on a friday night -rrb- . this place is connected to the bowling alley and tries to be a bar and a club combined into one . i do n't think they did a very well job of it though .	1
came for my first taco tuesday -lrb- ever -rrb- . sat by the bar - the bartenders were nice and always kept a good eye on our beer . husband and i tried a bunch of tacos . the $ 2 ones were okay , but we both like the	3

3.5-4 stars pretty packed bar on a saturday . we went when they were doing beer from all over . it was nice to be able to try different kinds of beer -lrb- ~ $ 6 -rrb- . the crowd was a mix between older people and 20-30 year olds	3
it 's a great setup so seats probably are n't that bad no matter where you sit , but the venue itself ca n't handle the number of people they can cram in there . there is always like a half hour of waiting in traffic just to get in	2
had the croque madame for breakfast and it was fantastic . delicious albeit a little pricey for what came on the plate -lrb- one egg ? boo . -rrb- my only qualm was that it was busy even on a monday morning and the employees do n't seem terribly happy	3

great place to watch a game . service was great and very attentive . with all that said the food was just so so . we did like the buffalo wings , great spice with a delicious tangy sauce . we were pretty disappointed with the chicken tenders and burger	2
huge fan of royal ! i have been to both the royal bar at union and storefront in the biltmore . love their lattes either hot or cold . i prefer the union location just because of the seating outside is nicer than the other location at the biltmore .	3

amazing place to eat . the cornbread is wonderful , it melts in your mouth . i have had just about every meal here and my favorite is the filet or the ribs . always great !	4
yum ! the ambiance in this place is a bit weird - it feels like a 1960 's thai diner - but the food and service are both fantastic . i tried out the thai hut fried rice and my husband had the drunken noodles . both were delish .	3
i wish i could do three and a half stars for this one . we called for takeout . i got the vegetarian soba noodles with tofu , and my husband had some shrimp and beef thing . when he got home and i opened the boxes , mine had	2

great pizza and philly cheese steaks . i 'm a big fan .	3
first time here , i was underwhelmed by the food . crabcakes were pretty tasty , but the tilapia and veggies were not good at all . our server was wonderful , he did a great job . the food was just not worth the price .	2

in my book this place deserves between 4 and 4.5 stars . it 's all about the <unk> bread . a limited menu but focuses on great sandwiches with quality ingredients . ca n't go wrong with the classic tomato , mozz , and basil sandwich . delicious . only	3
finally , a place up in the n. scottsdale area where i would n't mind hanging out . why 'd it take so long for someone to figure out that there are n't any n. scottsdale places for those over 22 but not quite in the 40 + crowd ?	2

this was goodness . we ordered the mozzarella cheese plate as an appetizer , which was really good . i asked our server what plates he recommended , and he said that if he went once in his life to the restaurant , he would eat either the meatloaf or	4
good sandwiches and good bread . gives me a panera feeling , but with definitely better quality and taste . tried subsequently the nine grain bagel , and that was really good .	2
great torta nortena . my gf told me about the place , as she saw it on man v food as well . i was in that area and decided to stop . the nortena has steak , chipotle mayo , cheese , avocado , grilled onion and do n't	3
brio tuscan grille is a chain of formula restaurants serving northern italian inspired food , much like <unk> 's little italy is a chain that serves more southern italian inspired food . it has about 30 locations and is hq in ohio . there is another one in gilbert ,	3
well , hate to join the bandwagon , but this place is the real deal ! i went here based on yelp reviews , which after almost a dozen , averaged 5 stars ! but several were from newbies to sushi , so i was skeptical , even with a	4

this cute little neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot just opened up , and is the sister restaurant to tuck shop . the menu is small with super reasonable prices !! not much in the way of vegan fare , but i managed to find a tasty dish : the red flannel hash	3
ok , so i have stopped in twice now , and both times were quite nice . the first time i just had a scoop of their <unk> vanilla ice cream with some salted caramel on top . it was good , but the caramel was super salty ... a	4

it 's friday ... i ran this morning ... i 'm running a half marathon on saturday ... damn it ! i can have a donut , or two . i 've been smelling bosa a few times a week on runs and finally i decided i could stop <unk>	2
4.5 stars ... and at least 10 <unk> . ahh , nothing like a hip campus joint to make me regret the fact that i have to shave on a regular basis . fortunately , my longing to <unk> my <unk> was distracted by the great coffee . the space	3

this is my favorite restaurant in the phoenix area . there , i wrote it ... and i am sticking to it . first off -- fresh local , sustainable , organic are not just words on the menu and the website . now , in places like san francisco	4

i come here to feel young and it works ... but often i leave , or <unk> , feeling old . that 's what great beer , much better than average bar food , and a young staff who think of you as that funny -lrb- and hopefully not creepy	3
the clothes are awesome . the prices are awesome . so why 2 stars ? customer service . obviously all the employees are there to get a discount on already cheap clothes because they do n't acknowledge you . there 's attitude when you ask for a dressing room .	1
they offer weekend brunch now !!!! donut holes , eggs benedict , biscuits and gravy . life at the windsor is lovely .	4
it seems they spent all of their money making the restaurant look great so could n't spend anything on making the food great . do n't get me wrong ... the food was n't bad . it just was n't great . there is n't anything that i thought ,	2
i wish we had more people with us so that there was a reason to order everything on the menu . my coworker called me up and said let 's go to lunch . she asked me what i was in the mood for and said i had n't been	4
i came back for my birthday . in order to celebrate in true <unk> fashion , we ordered pretty much everything on the menu . i 'm not exaggerating here . everything was good . everything . you seriously can not go wrong with anything on the menu and i	4
this placed <unk> me . my meal was tasty and good enough to start my day . nothing above or below good enough . i only saw one table drinking coffee around me . on a cold day , that can only mean your coffee sucks . so i opted	2
fun place for wings and drinks . lots of great sauces . this place will do a sauce tasting for you , which is pretty awesome . my favorite <unk> rubs : desert heat -lrb- also good on <unk> chips -rrb- mango habenero honey bbq hot	2
fun place to go to late at night when you 're in need of delicious food . their hours are <unk> , making it a great place for a late night snack . every time i 've gone they 've run out of some ingredients , which is disappointing but	3
delicious , inexpensive , fluffy donuts !	3
be ready for very casual , cafeteria style dining . no need to dress to impress , although i have seen multiple groups of people in evening attire at this restaurant . i think they must go for the great food regardless of being over dressed . favorites : beef	3
what happens when a great atmosphere , great service and great food <unk> ? well , you have to be at windsor . if i have a free evening and want to go out to an enjoyable meal in a relaxed atmosphere we just hop over to windsor and enjoy	4
after a long morning of volunteering at a local animal <unk> my coworkers and i sat down at the famous -lrb- infamous -rrb- los dos molinos for a filling lunch . i know 10 people at lunch is a challenge , but the place was empty and we were treated	0
this is definitely one of phoenix 's dirty little secrets ! an amazing pizza place in the middle of town . there are other `` big '' names in the area , but in my opinion the biggest name of them all is pino 's . this place is absolutely	4
we came here before a <unk> game for a drink . the staff was very nice and the fresh cocktails were tasty !	3
stay very friendly . the food was just ok - if you 're in the area and are looking for a quick lunch i would recommend .	2
i will definitely be back . our service was off - appetizer ordered did n't make it in , as well as one of the entrees . someone came over and offered to take the appetizer off the bill which we thought was very nice . however , when we	3
well right when we got here , we were treated to a line that was four couples deep , room enough for three . i figured i 'd spend a little time answering email , but their wifi was locked down . the hostess asked manager `` lee '' for	2
yes , there 's one realistic review of <unk> here , then the wide ranging ones , so i 'll just tell you some of my deals : men 's <unk> jeans with the original labels : $ 30 -lrb- $ <unk> <unk> -rrb- ; new <unk> slip <unk> $	3
move over matt 's ... new menus , dog friendly patio and wonderful caramel french toast , fresh bacon for the pooch makes this the best all-around early eatery for the valley !	4
my wife and i ate here last night . they had a special going ; a 3 course dinner for 50 $ , and we both opted for it . the place is very well designed , and very tranquil with fountains , and flowers . its like you stepped	4
hands down the best cheesesteak in town , period . even the two east coast guys i went with said it was as close as they had gotten from home . that says a lot coming from these <unk> i was out with for lunch today ...	3
this has to be one of the very best sandwich places to hit up for lunch in downtown phoenix ! if you havent tried this place you have got to give yourself some time and come on down ! there was a group of us the other day for lunch	4
do you fancy yourself a music snob ? then this is the place for you ! if you can find it at target , you probably wo n't find it here , which is why i love it . within the confines of the four tiny walls lies a treasure	4
this place is great . the people are nice , the coffee is so good , and the free wi-fi is definitely a bonus . my only complaint ? that it is n't in my neighborhood . that said , i go to copper star for the coffee . i	3
i 've found a new grocery shopping destination ... and i think i may be in love . sure , i do n't know what half of the items on the shelves are used for , and i do n't really care for dates , but there is just so	4
mucho gusto es mucho <unk> . let me say first , that the place is cute , the staff is friendly , and the salsa is good . there . i 'm not being a total jerk . the food , however , left much to be desired . i	0
the food is decent , but a word of advice . never sit outside if you see ducks out there . case and point - i met my ex there for lunch . the ducks were very active about leaving their <unk> on the porch area where we were sitting	2
been here a couple of times , food is always great , service is always great . what more can i say ? eat here . i would say try a specific item , but honestly i have n't had one yet that was bad .	4
i have attempted to go to oregano 's 5 times . i have actually eaten here 3 times . the food was good , the parking is terrible . i would be able to give this place 5 stars if i didnt have to fight for parking and a table	3
well at least they do n't use crappy cup o ' noodles right ? i got my ramen to go , i do n't know if that <unk> my quality ? anyways lets get down to business ... i got the republic ramen , its named after the place it	2
went to brio for a nice dinner . it had great service -lrb- as to be expected -rrb- . server knew his `` <unk> '' well , but did n't know much else about the dishes . i ordered the shrimp <unk> and my girlfriend ordered the sweet potato something	2
second time i came in , food is pretty expensive , but its well worth it . i do recommend getting the bruschetta , you pick 4 different ones -lrb- which are cut into nice 4 slices each -rrb- . we got the salmon , roasted peppers , tomato jam	3
so this place i would rank in the same exact field as spinatos . this is a tough category to be in . not quite sure what they were going for with the decor . there <unk> tv 's everywhere -lrb- in the <unk> -rrb- section of the place .	2
revolving sushi is supposed to be cheap and not the best quality . so i give you a 3 star , i have had better conveyor belt style sushi before . it is nice to have one of these close to where you live . good for eating on a	2
i ca n't decide ... 3 or 4 stars ??? service is probably what is going to push it up to four . this place has the best thai tea that i 've had up north . this is what sets it apart for me . their spice is a	3
mmmm delicious . had the <unk> lamb burger . i love how it was n't purely ground , but more like pulled lamb ? not sure if that is how lamb comes out when it is ground or if it really was . anyways this burger was amazing . perfectly	3
i had a pork dish when i was here . it was pretty good . the wait here was long . definitely make reservations next time we come . the nachos we had as an appetizer was large , we split it between 7 people -lrb- remember an appetizer not	3
food is ehh here . but the games are fun if you come with a few friends . drinks are never consistent , one day they will be pure sugar and the next it will be the best pours ever . . but you have to expect that going into	2
i used to come here all the time during high school . inexpensive food , great greasy burgers , the fries here are delicious ! they have many different flavors of milkshakes , i usually get the butterscotch . no restrooms , limited seating space , i recommend getting your	4
this place seriously does have the best pie in the entire world . drive up and bring a few to take home . try the mixed berry crumble , it 's incredibly delicious .	4
very good food	3
best horchata ever ! the tacos and salsa were also some of the best i have ever had . try the mole taco .	4
great service and amazing food . maximum calories per dollar . just awesome !	4
i think that when you wait so long to eat the food , the anticipation itself and your increased hunger leads you to believe that this is the greatest pizza on earth . the pizza maker was a bit irritated that i asked him not to burn the crust .	2
a packed restaurant in the middle of the afternoon , now i know why . they have great food , good prices and beer that does n't give you a headache . the wait staff was very nice , attentive , young girls with new breast <unk> -lrb- why do	4
third time is definitely a charm . first time : i had a gift certificate , tried the panini and an awesome selection of red wine i ca n't remember . after hearing so many great things about postino , i was quite disappointed that night . my panini was	4
i drove by this restaurant last week and remember thinking `` wow , that font style is very fox <unk> ! '' <unk> , i was n't wrong ! my friend and i had dinner here on saturday night for her <unk> farewell . we were told by the hostess	2
amazing customer service and sushi . mediocre robata items . i had the best birthday dinner here about 3 weeks ago . the couple who brought me here had been here 2 other times , so i knew i was in for a treat . we sat at the <unk>	3
let me preface this review by saying that i am not a coffee person . i would like to be a coffee person , but whenever i drink coffee i experience unfortunate side effects like running as fast as i can and spinning around in <unk> chairs . so when	2
coming from the flagstaff bookman 's , i always think , whoa ! this place is huge ! they have a large selection of everything , and i usually spend a lot of time in the travel section , fiction , <unk> , <unk> , and records . i am	3
i 'm a fan of sandwiches ... and not plain sandwiches , neither . i want all the fixins , unexpected toppings , and bread options you have to offer ! sacks delivers in these essential categories . first , they have two killer vegetarian options . the <unk> has	3
i have always loved the phoenix art museum and remember seeing many exhibits there on class field trips ! i guess i 'm a grown up now , but i still like to go when they put something new up . right now the front hallway is covered in black	3
so cute and it fits right in with its vintage , funky neighborhood , being a <unk> gas station and all . they have a small seating area inside and a nice patio as well . the coffee was good and there is a big selection of <unk> and sons	4
the only negative thing i could possibly say about this spinato 's is that it 's just too far from my office . any time i want to eat there for lunch , i have to get take out and come eat it at my desk . and let me	4
i was very happy with my visit to perk . recently , one of my co-workers came in to work raving about the breakfast he had at perk , insisting i try them out as well . well i figure , who am i turn down such an endorsement ?	4
i had intended to give this sandwich place four stars - because it seemed excessive to give any sandwich place five stars -- but hey , on reflection what could they do better to get that extra star ? nothing - so five stars it is . really big inventive	4
chinese buffets are gross things . there 's a reason they 're cheap , folks . so - <unk> on a curve - this is one of the best . note that i 'm not saying it has great chinese food , i 'm saying by the <unk> standards of	2

i love it . an amazing <unk> building full of all kinds of cool things . the food was fantastic , the music was fun , the fresh squeezed lemonade was tasty and the atmosphere was super cool . no <unk> here .	3
i still ca n't get a handle on this place . depending on the time of day you seem to attract either mostly elderly alcoholics or douchebags from the suburbs . where are the hipsters ?	2

after living in tempe for 2 years , i 'm very grateful to be now living within 10 minutes of this whole foods . if i had to rank all wf in the valley , this would n't be at the <unk> top , but it 's a huge improvement	3

yes , the service is slow , but the food is fantastic . i say this while eating leftovers for breakfast ... so . yummy . great cheese selection , awesome , jam packed menu , cool drink list . i had the cheese , garlic and tomato lavosh pizza	3
great location , sucky parking . being so close to the mall you have to drive around and find something . the food was what i have come to expect . they were able to accommodate our party of 10 in a matter of minutes -lrb- lunch made that easier	3

such a fun store ! they have all kinds of gifts like jewelry that i have n't seen other places , and a ton of books ! in my opinion an <unk> amount of <unk> is taken up by hippie / spiritual / new age stuff . the science fiction	4
while the happy hour prices are friendly , this place is simply not for me . the `` scene '' was very `` wannabe hipster , '' to a laughable extent . i was here with some coworkers , but would never visit this place on my own time .	2
bland . while the decor is lovely and the customer service was above average , the food was just not impressive . i was disappointed , because the menu left much to desire . if you want some seriously great thai food , try the pink pepper in mesa .	1
several years ago i made a dinner reservation for my fianc 's birthday at kai . if you know anything about that place you 'd know it 's the only five diamond restaurant in arizona , so it sounded like it would be an amazing spot for a birthday celebration	4

i see a lot of really great reviews here for this place . i think it boils down to the type of place you are looking for . my thing is finding little family run ethnic places where the food is good and the prices low . service is important	1

davanti <unk> joins the very small group of restaurants serving fine food in attractive surroundings at reasonable -lrb- sort of -rrb- prices . the cuisine is certainly italian , but not like what you would find in a traditional italian establishment -- this is more like what you would expect	4
the food is actually three star or maybe a bit better , and the ambience is okay . the problems : 1 . very expensive for what you get . 2 . a wait staff that <unk> you to death . i 've been to a number of brazilian steak	1
i almost desperately want to give north five stars , because the food is really something special , but it has one huge problem -- its very , very noisy -lrb- outside may be better if it is cool enough -rrb- . about the food - traditional italian fare is	3
hands down , the best part about this place is the patio . it 's cozy with a large brick fireplace , <unk> trees , and <unk> of white <unk> lights ! the restaurant actually opens out to the patio . this place is high end and the prices show	2

beautiful resort that you can take out of town visitors to for fine dining , drinks and spectacular <unk> !	3
incredible happy hour at the bar ! the burgers are delicious as are the bbq shrimp !	4
new location 3 star quality food .	2
their smoothies are divine and any soup there is delicious !	3
oysters are always fresh and flavorful here ! the fish and chips are under 10 dollars and are enough for two full meals !	3
great food and a good place to go after the old town farmers ' market . the guacamole is delicious and not over-rated . they know how to make a great margarita here !	3
parking is limited but street parking is plentiful . you can see your food prepared in their open kitchen . try any of their tacos !	3
great place to go with out of towners after a downtown game ! the drinks here are better than the bar food !	3
it 's okay . i think there are cheaper and higher quality vegan foods at whole foods ! if it were n't so close to the asu campus and scottsdale , it would n't be that busy !	2
the workers here are nothing like the <unk> , hipster <unk> at other pita jungles -- they are actually nice ! they let me order from the kids menu and i got a chicken pita , hummus and drink for 5 bucks plus tax ! i will be back !	4
i am a fan . this small taco shop that is family owned is just the right kind of place to go for lunch for some fast very good mexican food . do n't go in thinking that its going to be a sit down place that will serve you	3
the very best breakfast in town . very big portion and the atmosphere is great , farmhouse kitchen table . five stars for every aspect of my first trip there . i promise you will not regret it . if you go on the weekend you will wait in line	4
i got a piece of red velvet cake . the frosting is so rich and creamy with a very buttery finish and lots of cream cheese . the cake is tasty but dry . good thing there was lots of amazing frosting to cover that flaw up . the place	3
cupcakes are to die for ! butter creme frosting is the best in town . i do n't see how anyone can not love this place . yes the cupcakes are a lil overpriced 3.25 a piece but its totally a little bit of heaven . i took my grandma	4
its ok . i had the red chili plate . one of those deals where the cook should taste their food before it goes out for the day because the red chili was awful . the meat was fatty and of low quality . the seasonings were bland and no	2
kiss the cook is one of those places where it seems like a 50/50 chance that you will either have a good experience or an ok one . judging by the initial reviews you would think this place is the go to breakfast place . that is n't the case	2
food : this place has some pretty good middle eastern food . the hummus was awesome , and the <unk> are always tasty . you get a lot of food on your plate . the meat is actually tasty , as opposed to a lot of places that just throw	3

a very important indicator of mexican food is the beans . unfortunately , teepee served up <unk> , dry beans . a 2nd indicator is the margaritas . a drink with patron should have a bit of kick ; the bartender had a second chance to get it right -	0
understated decor matches simple flavorful dishes . great service and new bar area could prove popular . not for hearty eaters but still proves satisfying . all dishes were inspiring : home made mozzarella , raw fish , and gnocchi . every dish offered new <unk> into refreshing favors .	4
part of the initial thrill was beating the rush . however , the waiter 's control and pace of service let us savor the <unk> november day , and the mexican eats , on their fun patio . salsa is unique and has great kick , served with homemade chips	3
we had an indulgent friday and had appetizers with drinks at the pizzeria -lrb- trattoria -rrb- then moved on to a different restaurant for more <unk> . this location may stay as a good lunch location as it was way too stiff and really loud for a relaxing dinner .	2
happy hour provides nice value with filling , satisfying small plates : pork tostadas are incredible and have no comparison with a few of our fav mexican eateries . we are keeping our fingers crossed not to get the waiter again who is skimping on hair ties .	3
went to taylor 's cafe for a fear that the line at lgo and over easy would be too long . i wish i would have waited in line . the place was pretty empty so you would have thought our sever would have been a little more attentive .	1
since our first visit to joyride taco house on july 7th we have been there numerous times . we are huge fans of upward projects restaurants . it 's one of those restaurants where you just like `` being '' there . great music , great service , yummy food	3
let me start by saying , any business i come across is usually <unk> against a socal equivalent . why is that you ask ? because socal sets the standard . this may be an unfair advantage but i 'd like to think , i 've come across the best	2
never disappointed . everything about this place rocks ! they are very accommodating to dietary needs and every meal is exceptional . they have a band that plays on the weekends . great for groups or date nights .	4

if you 're not a fan of spicy food , stay away from phoenix 's los dos molinos . the new mexican restaurant `` does n't know how to make mild , '' meaning the salsas and sauces will burn your tongue off if you 're weak like me .	2

this place has yummy burgers and onion rings and is really clean ! they usually have a special burger every month or so , but one of my favorites is the bbq bacon burger with cheese . yum !	2
still giving it four stars and i 've eaten here four times since the first time i reviewed this places . i really like everything i 've had , but my favorite is one that my husband got the last time : sweet curry with nuts . he likes nuts	3

beautiful place , mediocre food . frustrating since i drive past it every week wishing we had a great mexican place in the neighborhood . nearby juan jaime 's is better and cheaper with <unk> the attitude .	1
loved it ! half expected a lame pf chang wannabe so was very surprised at how excellent and fun it was ! specials were terrific and cheap , and the bartender paul made us some of the better drinks i 've had in town .	3
my favorite is still the one on shea but this is also great . kids meal ca n't be beat . fattoush salad is great , so is the black bean burger -lrb- just add sriracha -rrb- . tapas portions at happy hour look great , but we always forget	3

i 'm not a fan of buffets at all , but for pink pepper i always make an exception . the food is amazing and even worth the lunch price if you only get one plate ! dinner is a little expensive but the food is still just as wonderful	4

i have been to bld 4 times and i have to say it is kind of a wreck . it is an `` upscale diner '' in a place filled with casual dining . it is overly complicated and expensive . my first <unk> was a happy hour that did	1
i really do not get all of the hype . the overall meal was okay . <unk> portion and very pricey . the dessert was pretty good but not worth the overall cost of the bill . my recommendation is to go for dessert only .	2
went to this place for happy hour and found they had some great drink and food specials . the food can be expensive but its good . the beers are good but i would not recommend getting the tasters . all of the beer <unk> were american beers you could	3
great happy hour place for fun and relaxation for co-workers . it is pricey if you go before happy hour starts . they occasionally have live music too if that is your bag -lrb- not mine -rrb- . but not bad for being located in the middle of nowhere .	2
this place is fantastic !! its not only a market , its also a restaurant , their beef shawerma is unbelievable ! and their service is great , if you shopping for <unk> arabic food you can find almost anything there , from tahini to <unk> * traditional <unk> food	4
excellent atmosphere ... great place for a date as well ! pizza was delicious and needless to say the nutella calzone was yummy ! what stuck out the most , again was the atmosphere . . i really enjoyed it !	3

i like this place . it 's a fun atmosphere , the bartender is really friendly and fun . the shots ` banana <unk> suckers ' are soooo good .	3
yummy salads and very thin crust pizza . probably the most thin crust i have ever had . the salads are all fresh which i love . this is a great spot for lunch or a light dinner .	2
my husband and i decided to try this place since it was minutes from our home . we were not disappointed ! we ordered a few rolls ; the crazy california which was pretty good , the amigo and the arizona were our favorites though . the rolls are smaller	3
not good and overpriced . one of my friends hyped this place up so i was excited to try it and it was a huge let down . i will not be going back .	1

picked up a pizza after work the other day . it was alright . nothing special but not bad . we just got pepperoni since the girlfriend is fairly <unk> when it comes to toppings so maybe if i got a specialty pie i 'd like it more . i	2

delicious breakfast/brunch with an emphasis on <unk> products . the sweet potato tots , like everyone says , are quite tasty . i tried the hawaiian breakfast -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- which came out on a fancy , modern white bowl , quite possibly the most chic looking breakfast i	3
probably the worst tasting stuffed cabbage i 've ever had . it was <unk> sweet -lrb- tasted sweeter than my soda ! -rrb- , and there were raisins in the tomato sauce which probably added to the sweetness . the ground meat on the inside on the other hand ,	1

so happy that i came here today ... i was already <unk> out at tempe marketplace -lrb- i was a little <unk> with my packages -rrb- i was hungry and almost did the horrible thing and have the cheesecake factory desserts at barnes and noble when i noticed tea infusion	3
ok i am poor ... and lifetime is the reason for it . but you know what ... i do n't care ... i heart lifetime fitness . it is the only gym that i actually feel comfortable working out in . they never tried to upsell me on packages	4
i wish this place was n't out of my way for breakfast or lunch , or i would be there more often . i went in there today for a last minute lunch idea ... i just love how friendly the staff is . the owner seemed to know everybody	4
wow , i ca n't believe these negative reviews . i went there last week for the first time and i have to say that i thought that it was wonderful . besides some service <unk> i thoroughly enjoyed my experience . my mom never had mexican food before -lrb-	3
sorry , it 's been a while since i 've been to the mission ; but reading someone else 's review made me realize ; i need to yelp . whenever i see corn on the menu ; i have to get the street corn - yummy !!! just always	3
i 'm kind of in awe of reviewers that think they know what authentic <unk> food is . i 'm no expert , do n't claim to be ; i 'm just a 3rd generation asian-american ; whose family mostly are <unk> of asian-american restaurants . taste is a subjective	3
sliders are the reason i first started to go here ; but i have grown to love the other food . always wanted to try white castle ; so , i 've gone to ones in cleveland , minneapolis - i love chicago hamburgers more !!! the fries are very	3
love this place ... great bbq , i get the greens to go in the <unk> quart container ... want to go back for the fried chicken sometime -lrb- served in the evening -rrb- ... i guess , i must pick all the good things on a menu ; because	3
i have n't eaten here for many years -lrb- decades -rrb- . was looking for a place <unk> to <unk> 's fish & chips -lrb- nw - seattle -rrb- chain . was hoping that i could find the fish similar ; it is the breading is very <unk> to what	3
i used to go to the location on <unk> ; been going to honey bear 's since the early 90 's ... love honey bears ; it 's great they are in central phx -lrb- closer to me now -rrb- ; i see they have greens on the menu -lrb-	3
i love you thai hut !!! : -rrb- i must admit , yesterday was sunday and you were closed so i cheated on you with the thai elephant . i now realize that even though it was delicious and fun , you are the only one who can satisfy my	4
i got ta tell you i love hannys . if you do n't know the story hanny 's used to be a department store about 50 years ago . the city considered the painted sign on the building to be a city land mark so they decided to just keep	3
i love you fez ! if i was n't married i might just move in with you . this place has `` it '' down . they have the wow factor and keep it going . the menu is diverse and has some really different items that are fantastic !	4
due to being a vegetarian , the pure thought of in-n-out used to make me feel a little <unk> and queasy . i mean that 's a lot of meat being pumped out of one chain . i digress . anyhow , i got dragged there and boy oh boy	3
typical amc . i 'm not really a great person to review theaters because i do n't get the appeal . i prefer my netflix and <unk> . cheaper , i can drink , watch on my own time , eat whatever i want and lay on my couch !	3
hooray ! we finally made it here for lunch . it felt as though we were in downtown phoenix again due to the hip and locally owned feel . i wish there could be so many more places like this in the neighborhood . the building is small and charming	4
my favorite phoenix area pizza ... and i have been everywhere . try the unique , <unk> rustica pizzas . wine selection is good and the ambiance is really nice , romantic , yet not over the top .	4
top notch for dessert and coffee in old town . great selection of gelato and cafe choices . the furniture is all modern and the vibe is very upscale . great place .	4
great old town bar . cheap specials every day . the food is well above `` bar food '' genre . the vibe is always vibrant and noisy ... in a good way . eat here for breakfast , lunch or dinner . one of my `` go to ''	4
this is a hidden gem . tucked away in a plaza , this place has very authentic food . the best part is -- they serve chinese and italian food ! the pastas are delicious . they also have a sushi bar ! near midtown phoenix , this place is	4
one of my favorite places to hit happy hour in old town . this along with the adjacent cafe zuzu at the hotel are great places to show friends from out of town . the whole hotel is vintage and trader vics is a polynesian paradise . food is comforting	4
cool treasure , kind of hidden in downtown chandler . obviously a great and local wine selection . but the impressively tasty italian food made the night a good one . service staff is very knowledgeable as well .	3
this place is a secret . it is a little hard to find in ahwatukee . but go find it . ahwatukee is seriously lacking in non-chain , quality restaurants . this one is a good one . great decor inside and the food was a little spicy but not	3
never been a fan of the food here . very mediocre . that being said , this is one of the nicest mexican restaurants in terms of decor and ambience . on a good note ... the salsas are very good and taste fresh .	2
came in here on a random mid-week night with a few friends . when we got there , we were greeted and seated immediately . our server was very bubbly and explained every aspect of the restaurant and menu to us . i was incredibly impressed . we all order	4
for some reason i had n't gone to this location yet , even though i am a big fan of sports , bar food , and drinks . i went this last sunday with my roommate to watch some football . it was packed , but we were still able	3
4 stars for the grilled cheese alone . mmmmm , smoked gouda . never had anything else , nor am i going to venture away from eating anything but the grilled cheese . nothing really appeals to me , anyway . but i come here a lot because the grilled	3
grilled cheese & tomato soup ... and i do n't even like tomatoes ! delicious .	4
5 stars because they brought onion rings back , you can order chicken strips off the kids menu , and i 'm here every single wednesday .	4
my boyfriend and i ate here at couple of weeks ago . i had never eaten korean bbq before so we decided to try it . the food was good , but what i really liked in the restaurant was the fact that we could cook our own food .	3
i like going to red robin ; however , i do not particularly like the one located at the tempe marketplace . my boyfriend and i decided to eat dinner there last sunday night . we were pretty hungry and we thought that red robin would hit the spot .	0
yesterday i was on the hunt to find a restaurant in phoenix that served lobster bisque . unfortunately , i never found it . what i did find was firebirds . the only thing i had yesterday was a fruit smoothie . i was so <unk> down with work that	3
so it 's a chain . i like it . who is making up these <unk> rules that we ca n't dine at , write about , or enjoy a chain restaurant anyway ? i actually come here primarily when my mom is visiting because she likes it . so	3
3.5 stars . my husband and i stopped in for lunch after the farmers market in the same strip mall . i liked the warm feel of the place , and that the menu has some options that only have an asian twist . my f 'n loaded sliders -lrb-	2
my husband and i were given a collection of penzey 's spices as a wedding gift years ago , and it was one of the best gifts we received . little did i know , we would be moving to scottsdale a few years later and would find a store	4
great menu with lots of choices and classic rock music -lrb- that means the 70 's , not the 90 's little yelpers -rrb- . i have found the food to always be good , although they sometimes run out of things -lrb- ahi or crab cakes in particular -rrb-	2
well i promised my husband we would eat out less . we , meaning him and i. by myself , there is no we , just i , and i made no such promise . i had to go to staples , -lrb- never go to staples hungry -rrb- ,	2
3.5 stars for me . my first thought upon walking in was `` wow , it 's small . '' not a bad thing necessarily . could be a good thing in fact . i ordered a `` <unk> lady '' cocktail -lrb- gin , <unk> , lemon juice ,	2
more like whole paycheck market . looking for a way to <unk> the mental <unk> i feel when i think about where my burger comes from , but not ready to abandon my <unk> and actually become a vegetarian , i 've been looking for sources of meat , poultry	3
these little <unk> come from a small farm in nebraska still run by the family of one of the <unk> of pork on a fork . of course , the prices are higher than that you would pay in the mega grocery stores today . but for me , not	3
$ 9.95 for the dinner buffet that includes tandoori chicken and perfect garlicky naan brought straight to your table . i 'm pretty sure i had about $ 7 in naan myself . how can you beat that ? well it takes more than price for me to be happy	3
<unk> 's is exactly what scottsdale so sorely needs . a nice , friendly neighborhood joint to grab a drink for less than $ 10.00 -lrb- way less -rrb- that is unpretentious , warm , and inviting . you do n't even need fake <unk> or cougar attire to get	4
why is it they can make frozen yogurt taste like ice cream , but ca n't make regular yogurt taste more like a milkshake ? sure , the regular yogurt people <unk> all these flavors like key lime pie and apple turnover , but i 'm not fooled . i	3
i took my mom and my aunts to afternoon tea service recently . served in the lobby tea court , we were seated near the hotel entrance . i wished i had thought to request a nice window seat when making the reservation , but it was still a lovely	3
after hearing orange table had gotten their service issues corrected , i had to judge for myself . it 's true !!!!!!!! things were a little slow in the beginning , so i was worried . but once our server did make it to us , things were pretty good	3
the first time i went to mesa arts center was one of the first times i had been to mesa in many years , and i was skeptical . as we drove down `` country club '' passing beer world , the <unk> man , and a check <unk> business	4
you would think this place is actually in mexico given how long i had been meaning to try it . i can only say , i should have gone sooner . really good mexican <unk> the touristy crap or the <unk> up version . i tried the green chile and	3
my husband and i were at the tempe arts festival around lunch time , and i spotted la bocca . i had it mentally bookmarked for quite a long time , so i was excited to finally try it . i was somewhat disappointed . while i appreciate the pretty	2
if eddie 's house ever rents a room , i 'm moving in ! 4.5 stars , but i think i 'm too stingy with that 5th star sometimes . fear of commitment maybe ? i had dinner here with dottsy z before the infamous night at <unk> 's ,	4
had lunch here saturday afternoon . if you have ever been to first watch when it was here , you would not recognize the interior . the building has been completely remodeled to give a cozy lodge feel . i 'm talking scottsdale cozy lodge keep in mind . there	3
sat on the patio last <unk> lamp on of course . really lovely , and the waterfalls drown out the sound of traffic on hayden . i wanted sangria but did n't see it on the menu . not only did they have it , it is probably some of	3
i had a girlfriend visiting this weekend , and we had lunch here yesterday . i hesitated based on my first visit , but i did want to give cafe carumba a second chance . it was really slow to get our drink order taken , but the restaurant was	2
dear mr. betos : after finding an <unk> object in my guac that tasted <unk> like a piece of <unk> chicken judging from the <unk> it was in my mouth , you 've given me a reason to look to your neighbor to the south for my grease fix .	3
yep , i like it . another place i really only come to when my mom visits as she likes it . i ordered the tortilla soup tonight and it was really good . i 'm also a fan of the cornbread they serve in lieu of same ole '	2
old town scottsdale has a personality disorder . it tries to be one thing during the day and another at night . merchants are <unk> for hellish fees in order to provide the `` free '' parking so prices reflect this big <unk> as some have to make up six	2
i have to add another star . we were just there again last night and the food and service were once again the very best . there is nothing pretentious about this place . it 's like sitting down in a relative 's kitchen to have dinner . it 's	4
such yummy food . tractor pizza and avocado , beet , grapefruit salad were so good . hot wings were amazing , deep fried first . and the pop tarts , omg , yum !	4
the back patio is lovely in the <unk> ... my favorite is the mole !	3
i 've been coming here for the last 3 years and have to say it always delivers . the drink specials are addicting , the food is way beyond what you 'd expect at a bar , and the scene on weekends is packed full of people looking to kick	3
oscar mike golf ! with a side of whiskey , tango , <unk> . how is this so good . how am i <unk> the willpower to type as i am floating in a wonderful world where there is no such thing as war , disease , <unk> <unk> .	4
really great martinis and my favorite chicken sandwich around . only problem is the place gets old after you 've been there a few times . but it 's always fun for late night .	3
i really love this place ! i come here quite often with my family being that it 's done the street from our house . the service is quick and friendly and we 've grown seriously attached to our favorite waiter . i always order off of the specials menu	3
had breakfast on saturday ... homemade hash and eggs ! the coffee was great and the staff was prompt and friendly ! i recommend this place for a good meal !!!	4
i met up with a good buddy of mine for a little <unk> , a little ambience , and some yummy food . we were excited to try this place for the first time so here 's how it turned out : great parking was a pleasant surprise when we	3
so christmas `` dinner '' was kind of an afterthought this year ... travelling and a time warp sort of forced that on our little merry band and we were famished by 9pm . we went to a couple of other places first , one had an excessive wait and	3
i have a couple of quirky friends i meet up with once a month or so , and we just have so much fun . i wanted a diner waffle and sausage this time , along with coffee , and it really hit the spot . the wait staff is	3
so ... i had a hankering for the <unk> ricotta pancakes and met up with some of my pals to satisfy the craving this past sunday . we were greeted warmly by sergio who kept us well stocked with coffee and water . my pals had burrata and <unk> ;	3
yum ! still great and jamming folks in : -rrb- had hh there on friday -lrb- because i needed the <unk> <unk> combo -rrb- and really loved it . had the sweet potato and added some schreiner ' sausage but need to get the combo right next time i go	3
sprouts is a decent place to find the typical <unk> store selection of `` corporate '' organic foods like amy 's , but it does n't have the atmosphere or selection of a whole foods or the fun choices that you will find at trader joe 's . they have	2
awesome fresh ingredients , great <unk> scones , and an awesome location at the back of the farm at south mountain . morning glory cafe has amazing omelettes -- the greek and farm are my favorites . they also have delicious french toast . if you have friends come in	3
best spinach/artichoke dip ever ! and when i have company in town this place is a great choice . my family & friends are always super impressed with the food and the beer . the college crowd and the limited parking is a bit annoying , but again , that	3
do n't be fooled by the name , or that everything on the menu is vegan , this is not the place for anyone on a diet or `` watching what they eat '' . the food is delicious comfort food with lots of fried things , in large portions	3
how people can love this restaurant is beyond me . i 've been to multiple locations and they were all disappointing . the only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because i thought their breakfast was ok . every time i go here i am unimpressed .	1
picked up my new imac today . everyone is just super friendly and upbeat . i love good customer service . i did have to wait a bit , but everyone is just so nice i really did n't mind ! plus , i got to chat while i waited	4
drive past this place every day to and from my trek to work . i first noticed it a few months ago when they put up the signage . the cool , sans <unk> font and <unk> sign caught my attention . as a designer , i 'm always intrigued	2
holy hipster batman ! how this place has 4 stars is beyond me . the service is absolutely terrible . and if there 's one thing you should focus on above all , it 's the service . it gets 2 stars simply for being unique and interesting . it	1

i really dig this place . but honestly , i just love the atmosphere . it 's a perfect spot to go to on a nice day in phoenix . it 's admittedly very crowded during lunch and brunch -lrb- on weekends -rrb- , but so far i 've never	3
mixed ... success depends on your agenda for that day . busy , popping , happening and great band - scores high . other scores average . went there last night -lrb- sat -rrb- with two girlfriends -lrb- 6:30 pm -rrb- . sound system was so loud we could n't	2
it 's all about the views . the views from every floor . the views in every direction . i lay in my bed on the 7th floor and kept waking to check the changing views as the night progressed into morning . the most spectacular views were from the	3

i went here for the first time today during the lunch hour , and holy moly was it good ! a friend recommended it , so we all went -lrb- as a rather large group -rrb- to try it out . it 's not a very fancy place , but	4
they should have stayed in chicago . the worst service and one of the <unk> restaurant experiences i have had in years . we never could figure out who our waiter was ! they would take orders and disappear for eons . my wife 's pizza was delivered first and	0
the food is way over rated . good but <unk> service . we had to wave down the staff all dinner for chips and salsa , water , extra drinks and our check . the food was maybe one star plus . go to los sombreros for the real deal	1
yum . i love coming here for dinner . the food is always superb . i think it 's amazing that we have such a great seafood place in the middle of the desert . first off , the service here is first class . they know what they are	4
i must confess i have only been here for lunch , but it is one of the best deals in town for lunch . my friend and i just ate there and had chicken teriyaki , white rice , salad , 2 sushi rolls and a squid salad and only	3
i went here yesterday for lunch with a friend of mine and sat outside on their second story . the service was prompt and polite and the food was delicious ! i had the chicken sandwich and my friend had the rnr burger -lrb- we split everything down the middle	3
my favorite burger . period . this might be in my list of last meal foods . food is always fast , fresh and delicious . it 's awesome to still be able to find an old school style burger restaurant with a simple menu . you want chicken ?	4
this place is a great <unk> coast style italian grocery store that offers a wide variety of pastas and sandwiches . i 've been coming here since my asu days and found defalco 's to be a good deal for the money and taste for sandwiches . i almost always	3
finally made my way to this place after i first heard about it and it is pretty amazing . some of the items on the menu were very traditional to the izakaya concept , which is cool . the sushi was pretty standard and very fresh , but no different	3
i love record stores . let me repeat that : i love record stores . at 14 , i was singing the praises of vinyl to anyone who would listen , and so few of my peers understood that music simply sounds better on vinyl . at 25 , i	2
so a friend suggested we go to this awesome sandwich place for dinner - the only disclaimer he made was that it 's cash only . this was n't a problem for me , because places that only take cash are usually less expensive - those credit machines are n't	3
the best guinness in town . their mussels are delightful , as is the rest of their food . but really , i go here for the perfectly poured guinness .	4
let me start off by saying i am only giving it 4 stars because i love their happy hour and reverse happy hour . i have only gone once during <unk> hour times and felt ripped off . okay now that all the negativity is done , the happy hour	3
pretty good . looked it up on google local . only one size . recommend at least once . also , the shrimp , rice paper roll is really good -lrb- <unk> -rrb- . you should try it .	3
where to start , where to start . i do n't know if it deserves four stars or not . i am definitely stuck in the middle . what i liked : atmosphere , free piping hot corn bread served out of a skillet , and its been so long	3
the oatmeal cookie <unk> here totally lives up to the hype . it 's amazing . also , i tried a sample of graham cracker crust the other day and that was really good too . they have fancier toppings than most of the other froyo places and they are	3
i love this place ! i 've tried several different things here but my favorites are the gobi <unk> and the palak paneer . it 's all vegetarian which was awesome when i was a vegetarian but it 's just as good now even when i 'm not one .	3
this was my favorite restaurant in college . we came here all the time . the staff was always friendly , good service , and the sushi is so good and cheap . the tofu steak is great to start with , and if you 're going to skip sushi	4
bass pro shop is the bees knees . literally walking into this place makes me wish i knew how to do every outdoor activity known to man . the store is just awesome . everything you could every imagine is in here ... and more . we got all of	4
this place is awesome . even if you do n't need anything , just go here and check it out . it 's huge and filled with every kind of mexican food you can possibly imagine . everything is really cheap and they have tons of fresh produce . they	4
i love everything about this place . it 's healthy , it 's delicious , tons of organic options . you just feel good going here . the spaghetti squash casserole is really good , so is the panang curry with tofu ... but my favorite thing is the kale	4
definitely the best thai place in old town . always good service , never a wait , was quick for take out too . my favorite thing is the chicken panang and my boyfriend likes the yellow curry . we tried the siamese <unk> last time too and those were	4
i love you . i am not just saying that because of the amazing selection of craft beers constantly available to me . nor because of the seasonal and special selection craft beers that are ever rotating or the amazing prices . part of it might be the growler bar	3
i am never in scottsdale , ever . but this one time , i was on my way to my friends ' house in scottsdale when i was <unk> for my espresso and remembered that one of the coolest dudes i know -lrb- don s. -rrb- raved about this place	4
if you are looking for good authentic mexican food , this is the spot . my family has been coming here for years . it 's one of those places my long time separated parents can even agree on ! for starters , the chips and salsa are really very	3
my favorite things about symphony hall is how much culture to which it is actually a performance home . the ballet , the opera , the symphony , and more . you need not look further than symphony hall if you are in search of something to bring some depth	4
this place has the most comfortable comfort food i have ever tried ... my night ended in a food coma . so there . we walked in and were seated right away . i love the feel of this place . warm , welcome , quirky , and just the	4
you walk in and grab a menu , seat yourself and when you are ready to order you hop up to the register to made your selections . this place is cute , trendy , understated with <unk> bitty <unk> with a flower or two , lots of art on	3
not terrible but very expensive and a bit of an odd presentation . i stopped in for lunch the other day and sat at the bar . i found the menu a bit confusing but finally settled on the <unk> with collard greens . it arrived quickly . the plate	1
there really should be a two and a half star rating . i mean , come on , the territory between `` meh , i 've had better '' and `` a-ok '' is pretty vast . in any case , we popped in for happy hour to check it	2
really wanted to love it . and really did n't ! i was excited to see what was described as an `` izakaya '' style lounge - perhaps my favorite way to enjoy japanese food - but let me tell you , this ai n't no izakaya . an izakaya	1
i have to say i love this place . the fact that it 's around the corner from my house does n't hurt but i 'm a bit baffled by the haters here . expensive ? are you kidding ? it 's unpretentious , friendly and they have a great	3
i 'm afraid this is one of those `` i wanted to love it , but ... '' reviews . we had an assortment of tacos and burritos . they were fine but absolutely nothing special whatsoever . yes , they were authentic mexican tacos -lrb- i.e. , not taco	1
we 've been back to chompie 's several times and we really like it . everything we 've ever had to eat here is quite good and the service is always excellent . it 's definitely the best jewish deli we 've found in the valley .	3
great for happy hour - if you keep it simple - but not particularly good otherwise . this restaurant is in a very convenient location and there 's almost always parking right in front . you can sit outside on the patio and when the weather 's nice , it	2
if you like hot cucumbers , you 'd better get into ohso fast , because i 'd bet this place has a six month to one year <unk> . really , hot cucumbers ? my partner and i were excited to see ohso from the street , and i was	1
cool old hotel , interesting ghost stories . but everything else is just so-so . stopped in at happy hour and <unk> for a couple of drinks . the place was seriously dead as a <unk> at 5:45 pm on a friday afternoon . that says something about the community	1
i love filmbar . what could be better than watching an indie film with a good , cold beer in a place where only people with similar interests hang out ? the front section of the place , when you walk in , is a small bar with a good	4
i typically love bars like this that are n't full of people just trying to impress one another . the kind of bars you do n't dress up for , and just go to hang out with your friends and watch a game or play pool . i came here	1
i like coming here after work because they have a good happy hour menu . i like the edamame , philadelphia roll , shrimp tempura roll , and viva las vegas roll . i 've tried most of the other rolls and thought they were kind of blah . the	2
i went here for happy hour at 5:30 pm on a thursday and it was n't too crowded . we sat outside which was a mistake because it was so loud with all the bikes across the street . the drinks were just ok , and the brie appetizer was	1
great local bar with nice people and excellent service . i like to go there for monday night football because they put it up on a hd projector screen against a huge white wall outside , it looks great . bartenders are nice and quick to serve . it 's	4

this place is really cool and a lot of fun . inside is nice and clean . hip music playing in the background while you relax and dine . the best part is watching all sorts of tasty items cruising across the conveyor belt right in front of you that	3
came here to celebrate our daughter 's 30th b-day and brought both family , friends and the grand kid . she ask to go here and then next door afterwards for some snoh . sounds good to me . inside is simple and cozy with a casual rustic japanese theme	3

i came here after receiving a free pizza at a yelp event . upper crust had some of the best food at the event so i could n't wait to have dinner at the restaurant . my friend and i came here on a wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it	4
i came here with a friend before heading to the movies . i bought the yelp deal which was a gift certificate $ 10 for $ 20 towards your purchase . the servers were very friendly and knowledgeable . we had the endless chips and salsa and 2 shredded beef	3
pho was amazing !!!! this was my first pho experience , but i loved it ! i am coming back ! had the number # 13 , lean pork . they gave me a lot , i could not finish it .	3
good breakfasts options . they have your classics and some tasty healthy alternatives too .	3
got a craving for fish and chips ? best place in town i think . great fish and shrimp .	4
now i 've been to tia rosa several times and i 've always enjoyed the food and margaritas . i specifically love the grilled peppers and onions you receive with some dishes . that said , last time i was there , i ordered a vegetarian burro -lrb- $ 12	1
what can i say that has n't been said already . this place is great ! great decor , great food , great service ! living in gilbert , we do n't get over this way all that often , but i 'd definitely like to go back !	3
this place was pretty good . cute patio . margaritas are strong , but limited menu . i had the portabella tacos . did n't care for the blue cheese on them so next time i 'll try it without . i 'd definitely like to give them another try	2

i love eating here and the drinks are great . the bar staff is wonderful but for some reason the female wait staff continues to be off-putting . they seem unhappy to take our tables and when the bill comes they give us an <unk> receipt that leaves off the	2

best calamari in town , and awesome service . tokyo glow is a great drink , super refreshing .	4
so yummy and totally worth the wait . if you do n't want to wait , order to go and eat in the park . always ask what the special is , great for sharing .	4
a <unk> , trendy place , whose -lrb- to me -rrb- only two redeeming qualities are its eateries , and its proximity to my house . whoever designed this small outdoor mall never took a course in traffic flow patterns or how many parking spaces a mall of this size	1
do n't know about the happy hour , went here for dinner . very good seafood . the escargot was one of the two best i 've had in phoenix . the mahi mahi crusted with coconut was done to perfection . the shrimp in a spicy pomodoro sauce was	3

nice little corner place to grab a cup of coffee and have a morning meeting ... can sit inside or out . i 'm not big on the specialty coffees , so i only go to the outside spot , but the coffee was pretty good .	3

i wanted to like this place . the decor was cute when we walked in , the restaurant is a converted house , and the owner of the restaurant was the only one working besides a hispanic girl in the kitchen . unfortunately , the food and service were very	0
i love this place ! i have ordered a few different types of crepes and they have all been delicious . my favorite is the brie crepe . i even love the side salad !	4
great food and good service . the steak was cooked perfectly and i definitely recommend the mac and cheese as a side . my only complaint for the night was that the valet gave my car to someone else ! another guest got in the car and started driving off	3
not sure what all of the hype is about ... i would much rather drive to del <unk> in <unk> scottsdale . the sauce was rather sweet and the sides were overpriced -lrb- over $ 5 for a small side -rrb- . overall , it 's alright .	2
i was unimpressed with ruth 's chris . the decor was dated . the servers reached across the table to serve and remove plates instead of properly from the <unk> . we were even asked to hand them our dirty dishes . the plates they could reach were removed before	1

what an outstanding opening party today ... on st. patty 's day , none the less ! they opened for a select group of visitors from <unk> today and it included wine/beer and bruschetta for a cost of $ 25 . what a way to start off in the neighborhood	4
before i go any further , this is a 3.5 rating , not a full 4 ... i did enjoy hanging out here , but a few things could be improved . arrived on an early sunday afternoon and it was quite busy ... long line to order food .	2
love coming here ... even when i do n't plan on buying a book i 'm always ready to walk out with a few - their prices are competitive and they have such a great selection for being a <unk> bookstore that is not a chain . the best part	4
this place sits right next to liberty market and i 've always seen it with a long line for breakfast - i understand why , now . there are literally less than 20 tables in there and its small and crowded . . makes sense . it took our party	3
i was disappointed . i have not been to a sweet tomatoes restaurant for about 3-4 years due to their higher prices , but i went to join a friend for lunch on friday . their pricing is still high -- about $ 12 for lunch and a standard drink	1
my wife loves good tempura so we went to try this place . as most other reviewers have said , this place is just so-so . the prices are higher than most other japanese restaurants by about 15-20 % due to its location and ambiance . the tempura was mediocre	2

checked it out on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised . drinks are healthy pours and appetizers are <unk> enjoyable and enough for two . <unk> staff is happy to have us there . will have to return for dinner .	4

the best burger in phoenix . reminds me of how five guys burgers and fries used to be . the smashburger and smashchicken -lrb- fried -rrb- are delicious . ever since ordering the haystack straws , i 've never been able to muster up the motivation try the fries .	4

first of all the restaurant itself is cold , not comfortable . menu is interesting - but fairly limited for a breakfast joint , and when you get down to it the food is fairly bland . also pricey - 2 eggs , bacon , hashbrowns $ 8 . no	1

i had brunch here on a sunday morning ; it was fairly crowded and loud , which was fine by me . we opted to sit indoors since there was a 20 minute wait for the patio seating . plenty of high chairs available , and we were asked to	3
i really wish this location was closer to my house ! not only is whole foods chock full of yummy , organic and healthy groceries , but they also have hot food stations throughout the store . how cool is that ? lots of <unk> beef and organic <unk> options	3
decided it was time for a <unk> burger , had their bacon burger which was very good . not a real fan of the ambience and might stop by here on occasion .	2
my first time to patronage this establishment . service with amanda was excellent , food just ok -lrb- hot pastrami -rrb- . will give it another try , looking for that one dish i can always count on when the taste hits me ! for all my military buddies ,	2

i heard good things about this place , and was looking forward to what the `` basement '' atmosphere would feel like , <unk> , a little seedy , etc. . sadly , too many middle-aged men wearing flip flops out on a friday night . flip flops ? ugh	0
finally got to eat brunch at the morning glory cafe and it was fantastic ! the only downside was the cost of bloody mary 's ... $ 9 ??? that 's steep . for this time of year , the setting and the weather definitely enhance the dining experience .	4
the best place to find any gift for any person . baby ? <unk> <unk> . grandma ? candle or temp tattoos . boyfriend ? book or shirt . unexpected gifts , this shop is full of surprises . i really enjoy the small , <unk> collection of books they	4

i had the privilege of getting to try out ling & louie 's on shea for work -lrb- yes my job is rough -rrb- , and i really enjoyed it ! the atmosphere is casual and fun and the staff is so nice . they were very accommodating and attentive	3
love the dim sum on sunday afternoons . always end up bringing home a lot of leftovers as the little carts full of delicious food keep strolling by . dim sum is a great way to try a variety of foods and this is a great place for it .	4
great happy hour specials ! they also do a special during the summer when the temp hits a certain point they give free chocolate or cheese fondue to they 're facebook fans .	3
the house dressing is an absolute must especially on the old world classic salad . bottles are available for purchase & i believe a dollar off is given for bringing the bottle back for refills . servers are young and hip , my daughter used to say she wanted her	3
being a big fan of breweries i was not impressed with this place . they only had 3 of there beers on tap which i really did n't care for besides the double ipa . the food smelled and looked awesome which i will have to go back and try	1
first off i will say i am a new mexican and have lived in nm most of my life so i came into this place thinking i was going to be disappointed . well ... i was wrong . blue adobe knows how to make some killer new mexican dishes	3

thoroughly enjoyed splitting a small house salad and a small pizza today ! great amount to share for lunch with left overs . started with the house salad that has roasted red bell peppers , fresh mushrooms , cherry tomatoes , crisp lettuce and tossed with a tasty italian vinaigrette	4
if you do n't want to wait , get here before 5 or after 8:30 on the weekend . by <unk> they were waiting outside the door ! i have to agree with nicole on the pepperoni , feta , mozzarella ... it 's a perfect combo . thin crispy	3

probably should be a 3.5 . last time i was there was restaurant week . food was good , but firebirds was better . wait times here can be long . .	2
very good . if you want biscuits and gravy , get the half order . or get the on off the menu that comes with a meat and some eggs . point being ... lots of food either way . i 've never finished <unk> and eggs here ... ever	3
i 've been here several times now and it 's actually pretty good . the last time was in the for <unk> restaurant week . we ordered off the prix fixe menu . good value , good choices . 1st course . shrimp cocktail . good , albeit small shrimp	3

i 've been meaning to go back to this place for over a year now but i finally did today . got the same thing i did the first time - meat lover 's omelette with added hollandaise sauce - and it was still great . fast , friendly service	4
went in here right before lunch to try it out . got an indian taco -lrb- which does n't feel pc but since it 's owned and staffed by native americans , i guess they can call it what they want -rrb- with a drink for just over $ 5	3
got the boxty , a jar of coffee -lrb- refillable at 10 % off -rrb- , and the day 's special lemon tart . the food came out super fast and it was so good . <unk> boxty -lrb- 2 -rrb- with shredded apple and a sweet butter on top	4

just got back from a great lunch ! i got the 1/3 lb . burger with cheddar and bacon . overall , it was a little greasy but nothing less can be expected from a great burger place . the bun was delicious and the burgers were obviously <unk> ,	4
so , after a disappointing trip to the <unk> deli , which was sadly closed , we ended up at joey 's . and it was awesome . chicago styled food , included italian beef and dogs , sadly , no deep dish , and no gyros . this is	3
yardhouse is interesting . great beer selection , but usually overpriced , too rich , too salty , meh food . go for brews , maybe an appetizer , sit at the bar .	1
i 'm really surprised that so many people love this place , especially when there is better middle eastern food all over this town . first off , i did n't really know who worked here , and who did n't , and thought it was especially rude of the	1
finally . a vinyl store in arizona ! i have been going to rhr since they first opened , as `` the flagstaff guy '' . since then , the store has gotten more awesome as time goes on . the selection , the staff , all of it is	4
fast service ! if you want to grab some fantastic food like a calzone or pasta and have limited time ! this is the perfect place for you ! people with 30min to an hour for lunch it 's perfect ! they also have my favorite local brew santan brewing	4
service continues to get worse . . what is it with this place , i am really really trying to like them ! they are a great local place i want to keep frequenting , but if i have to continually remind them what 's in their antipasto platter .	1
this may be the coolest market place arizona has ever seen . this whole foods is truly a market . inside this store is contained an organic grocer , a deli , bbq food restaurant , wine & beer bar , cheese shoppe , <unk> bar & , wait for	3
i love how big the seafood section is !! and its very fresh ! they always have what i am looking for in making asian meals . their prices are fair and the lines are speedy ! lee lee 's needs another location ! closer to me in the tempe/scottsdale	3
i go there when they have their specials going on . . they are a little pricey , a little bland ... but its close to my location so i ca n't complain . i 've had better , so they would be average .	2
we had the angus sliders , grilled cheese sandwich and buffalo chicken sandwich . they all came with bacon on them - good quality and thick sliced but overcooked . we drowned the sliders with ketchup to try to get some <unk> and seasoning into them . . the buffalo	1
we tried the pig dip sandwich and the salmon flatbread . the flatbread and bread for the sandwich is made in house and you can tell . the flatbread is actually very fluffy and more like pizza dough than other flatbread dishes seem to be . i 'd definitely try	3
the gyro is good , the fries are ok but borderline salty , and i like that they give you the tzaziki on the side . the only bad thing is the price - 5.95 for the gyro , 7.95 for the combo . i 'll go back , but	3
went for dim sum and enjoyed it immensely . the worst thing about it was the wait staff was n't very attentive and did n't do much except refill the cups when they noticed they were low -lrb- which was n't very often -rrb- . the dim sum was plentiful	2
we kicked off restaurant week here and had a great time . the ambiance is great and they have music that can be a little loud but definitely not as obnoxious and distracting as some other scottsdale establishments . for first course we had spinach salad and the lamb slider	3
this place definitely does not do food like kittens do cute . . so we got the luis -lrb- ? -rrb- basically a shaved meat sandwich with mac and cheese <unk> for fries and the trio of chips and dip . the chips were salted very <unk> - some chips	0
it does n't help that the evening ended with me telling the manager/owner exactly what was wrong with all the food that i had tried there and him walking back in shaking his head in a surprisingly unprofessional manner . he tried to tell me this food wins awards every	0
this is the best pizza place i 've found in phoenix so far . truly one of the <unk> . i think they have a <unk> brick oven ? not sure if its a rumor or not ... but something makes their pizza delightful . very good new york style	4
i used to think this place deserved at least 4 stars but with the new happy hour specials -lrb- 1/2 off appetizers and <unk> , 1.50 some kinda shredded meat taco that you can get at <unk> for a buck <unk> -rrb- its gone down to a meh . .	2
butterfish <unk> was as great as ever ! also tried a fancy roll this time and sashimi platter . its awesomely fresh . i was actually impressed by the freshness of the fish . its expensive , the furniture is uncomfortable and something about the place is just douchey or	3
we 've been back a couple times more since and both times we 've gotten the cheese platter . its a little pricey at $ 18 but i would highly recommend it . last night we tried the halibut and the salmon . both were absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly	4
we got to try a lot of things because we had a <unk> fixe dinner living social voucher . it was awesome ! first , its nice to have attentive waitstaff that 's attentive as well as knowledgeable about the food . always positive , no attitude - we all	4

pizza was one of the best i 've had since i 've been in phx . <unk> space with cool lighting . bar setup was great and drinks were on point .	3
the owners have the food down for sure . they own a restaurant in san francisco and make thai that mirrors true thai cuisine . service was slow but i think they were just understaffed that night .	3
we met some long lost friends here last night . fast and efficient service . the only issue was that music was to start at 9:00 pm ... we left at 10:30 and the music still had not begun . at least we were able to chat with our friends	3
keep an eye on the register ... i do n't shop here often but when i do , they always over charge me ! as if their prices were n't high enough to begin with !	2
very nice environment . i would definitely go here again . the bartenders really know how to make some luscious specialty drinks !!	4

the new pita jungle in desert ridge is great , just like all the other locations ! this is not your traditional mediterranean place - they focus non offering healthy items at very reasonable prices . they have many of the staples of greek/mediterranean food , like gyros , chicken	3
i almost never give a chain restaurant a 5-star review , not because i 'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy . but bandera is just that good , from the upscale casual , relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food	4
scramble indeed . scramble away from this place and into your neighborhood ihop or village inn ... at least you 'll pay less for equally dismal food . i expected so much more from a new neighborhood place , especially one that 's gotten some good reviews and publicity .	1

this young and <unk> restaurant is <unk> for great weather . the open concept bar feels like it 's been <unk> straight from san diego . they have a great selection of craft beers on tap with local wines to boot . given the soft opening , they are still	3
what can i say ... it was a really good happy hour . this is definitely a place to be seen as there was n't an empty table in the place . luckily we got seated right away on the patio ... heat lamps included ! the waiter was able	4
checking out the $ 20 brunch go for the ambiance and bring a camera . it 's a fun field trip to try to find or even get into the saguaro hotel . they 've done a great job renovating the entire property and has the feel of a big	2
it 's definitely a treat . i got to split one with a friend after eating at green and it was excellent . a nice alternative for avoiding dairy . not sure of the flavor , but pretty sure it had bananas and cookies . one is more than enough	4
we visited on a friday afternoon and caught the tail end of happy hour . also catching some tail was some guy who came in with a young lady who was clearly an escort . i was upset that our seating only allowed us to see , but not hear	2
we hit hula 's on a friday evening to grab dinner and a drink . the restaurant is just a ways from the light rail so , from a convenience standpoint , this is a plus . we had a couple themed mixed drinks and , like others have said	3
out after a friday baseball game with another couple , we were loaded up quite well and the ladies decided amsterdam was the logical place to go . of course -- cooperstown , dbacks , amsterdam ! being in my fan gear -lrb- sedona red jersey and slip <unk> -rrb-	3
turf is good . not really a place to bring to impress the hell out of people . good though . it always works as an `` i do n't know where i want to go to eat ... i 'll just hit turf . '' they recently added <unk>	2
ambiance , excellent food , a great selection of fine liquor . it is hard to get better than house of tricks . one of tempe 's gems that we can all hope will not be <unk> out of existence -lrb- i 'm looking at you tempe city <unk> !	4
i had been to bliss a number of times for brunch , the experience was excellent . however , when i went there for dinner that was the kicker ! this place is awesome ! sriracha aioli , i was thinking of ordering more stuff just to try dipping it	3
hard to blame the stadium for all of the sucky games i have seen here -lrb- <unk> when the <unk> are in town -rrb- . this really is a nice ball park . its also great that there are almost always cheap seats , and they have a damn good	3
i ca n't believe i am updating my review for bliss/rebar with a negative experience . the <unk> -lrb- which i think was the problem , bartenders have so much to do that waiting on 16 or so people can get tricky -rrb- was initially very responsive to our table	1
the coronado coney . it is one of the greatest things on a menu ! get it on saturday when you can get vegan chili on top , after all what is better to do with vegan chili than to put it on a giant hot dog ? the dog	3
want to get drunk ? i mean falling over , possibly having sex in public ... but you 're not sure if that really happened drunk ? this is the place . described aptly as `` 7-11 on acid '' the giant bank of alcoholic <unk> , er <unk> ,	2
i am pretty sure ted 's has its status as a go to place here in az because of nostalgia . there are many places out here that are really not that great but because growing up these poor bastards had no good food are way over-rated at this point	1
i had a great first experience at the brat haus ! danielle our server was extremely knowledgeable and attentive . we had the scrumptious pretzels , with a side beer brat , a spicy brat , belgian fries , , and the haus favorite burger . everything had sooo much	4
loved this place ! never knew a boxing ring , dance floor , ice cream shop , clothing shop , and restaurant could all be in one bar ! i was even more pleased to see a moscow mule on the drink menu . it only ran me about 7	4
i enjoy this place so much ! i have been a frequent customer and am rarely disappointed . i recently met a friend here whom had never been before . <unk> , turns out to be `` ladies night '' and our food and drink were half off ! i	4
great pizza at a decent price , with horrible counter service . a <unk> search of the word `` rude '' on this place 's yelp page will show 4 results , which does n't surprise me the least . make that 5 results now .	2
i have to say , i went to a lot of different <unk> 's establishments throughout the <unk> , when i was in military . it was the natural place to go when you 're a bunch of young , <unk> guys being shipped around from place to place .	1
my boyfriend and i came here on a saturday night jazz night once and i 've been here a couple of times for coffee . i really want to love this place but i just ca n't get into it . each time i 've been i have n't been	1
i love sidebar . it 's sleek , modern , and gives you the feeling you 're looking out the window and into another city . i have been several times and am never disappointed . they have a wonderful list of cocktails -lrb- my favorite being the <unk> palmer	4
`` shopping healthy and local is more expensive '' is a myth -- even when talking about our <unk> friends -- and noble beast proves it . in addition to all-natural , quality health pet <unk> that you will find for a lot more $ elsewhere they also have an	4
i have never been into soul food per se , but my husband woke up craving some chicken and waffles , and well , you can guess where we ended up . we were so pumped that there was kool aid on the menu , so we ordered that immediately	2
is it true that i have n't reviewed forefathers yet ? i am in serious disbelief . forefathers is like my favorite thing ever ever ever . for starters , the service is so wonderful here . it is family owned , so it definitely has a warm , inviting	4
i visited tempe farmers market a couple years ago when it opened for the first time . it was less than impressive and i had never intended to go back . fast forward to a couple months ago and my roommate and i decided to stop in because we were	4
the food and service are both fine here , but i 've experienced better . i love love love that this is so close to my house . my husband and i walk over there a lot , usually later at night to enjoy the late night happy hour .	2
i really do n't like hamburgers that much . i know this makes me <unk> , but it is what it is . i was at one point dragged to this place since a bunch of friends were meeting up and i was n't about to miss out on fun	3
went last night with a table of 6 . had a great time -- got to sample several different pizza 's and were impressed by the quality of ingredients used in the toppings -- i loved the sage and sausage combo , and that fact that the pepperoni was actually	4
copper star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the melrose curve . who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans ? their coffee is locally roasted and , while not	3
the ruby room is a mid century gem . basically it 's a dive bar that has maintained a sense of class . great decor , intimate vibe , friendly attentive staff , and a lot of cool bands . the only problem is the sound system : overly loud	2

first spa i have treated myself to here in the valley and overall i had a pretty good experience . i got the hot stone massage and it was <unk> . the other amenities were just so so . it 's not very big but it is still very nice	2
so the b/f has been <unk> for awhile to check this out place and even though i was not really in the mood for `` bar food '' i gave in . inside is decorated pretty cool . the menu is creative in the naming and they do have a	2

had a wonderful experience here from first drink to last bite . atmosphere has a nice chic upscale feel to it and the lighting is nice and cozy . we waited in the nice bar while we waited for our table . the orange martini they have is just heaven	3
sweet potato ravioli !!!!! absolutely wonderful . also tried the spaghetti carbonara and they did not mind adding eggplant to it for me , and it was just delicious as well . cute little place with an overall good food selection . they have an extensive wine list as well	3
well yesterday i was a total chicken junkie . i wanted more after i devoured 4 pieces . seriously the best grilled chicken i think i have ever had . yes , i had major munchies but this is beside the point . it was seriously beyond satisfying and i	4
do n't get me wrong , it 's a cute place for families and kids but the parking was a bit unorganized and the prices were a little steep for entrance and all the extras inside . we went for the pumpkin & chili party and i could n't believe	1
i 'm normally not opposed to greasy food , but i did n't like that my burger bun was soaked . do n't get me wrong , the beef and the fries were excellent . service was quick , staff was friendly , and their soda machine is awesome .	2
i 've been going to `` <unk> sea '' -lrb- that 's what the cool kids call it ... not really -rrb- for a long time , and even though it 's quite a trek to go there from glendale it 's always been well worth the trip . there	4

for a place called `` grapevine '' i 'd expect the wine menu to be at least decent . i have gone to this place several times for food , drinks and karaoke - i enjoy the view from the upstairs patio -lrb- i highly recommend sitting there -rrb- .	1
sushi is great - service is good and each time i have dined there with my toddler , they have been great . they have a pretty good kid 's dish that my kid enjoys as well . the wine list leaves much to be desired -lrb- wine lovers have	3
sushi was so-so , the wine list was n't anything to make me want to go back . they seemed to have a lot of interesting looking cocktails but i prefer wine with my sushi . we were n't in a rush so i ca n't really comment of the	1
love this place ! try the sweet potato tater tots !! great pizza too !! go steelers !	3
this place is good they have a great selection of beer and wines . i will be bringing my mom back to try the crab cakes for sure as she is a fan and they were pretty darn tasty . make sure to try the garlic fries too - they	2
love this pizza - consistently good and you ca n't beat the pepperoni . our favorite is the white garlic pizza with pepperoni . the cheesecakes are awesome too . free pizza on your birthday if you sign up on their website . one negative experience with a waitress ,	3
first off , i have to say that i 'm not a beer drinker . hubby ordered the sampler -lrb- a small glass of each of their brews -rrb- and i did n't like any of them , even the peach ale . he liked most of them thought ,	2
came here for the end of the yelp shops local event in downtown scottsdale . the decor was super cute and all of the staff were friendly even though i 'm sure they were working outside of their normal hours . the menu included kicking spicy bloody mary 's ,	3
after driving past this place many times hubby and i finally went here for our anniversary , after seeing all of the positive reviews on yelp . we were looking for something a bit unique , with a similar feel to melting pot but without the $ 100 tab .	3
my friends and i went here for the first time last night and we were very happy ! their happy hour menu is fantastic ! we got the philly roll , crazy boy , spicy tuna tempura , and shrimp tempura . they were all really delicious and had sooo	3
food is decent . service is kind of lousy . and the clientele is grimy ... so grimy to where i have to sit outside to not be disgusted when i 'm eating .	2
the last time i came to this place was over 5 years ago and they had good food and good service . however , today was a different story . i wanted to take my best friend here for breakfast and here is how it went ... actually it didnt	0

this is the best local sushi spot i 've ever been to ... and i have been to all of them . there is nothing like this place ... such a fresh , authentic , flavorful taste to every roll and all of my girlfriends agree . it 's such	4
fabulous place to go to on the weekends ! friday and saturday nights are perfect ... not too crowded , not dead either . bartenders -lrb- only the guys though -rrb- are amazing . they take your order fast and fill up your drink with the more than expected liquor	4
tried this place for breakfast over the weekend and it 's definitely not what i expected for a breakfast spot . you order from a selected menu and pay up front ; then , they give you a number and you wait at your table . their coffee is awesome	2
ahhh , i wish i did n't have to leave a less than fabulous review for this place . i so wanted to love it , <unk> i ca n't . let 's start with customer service : it was awful . the hostess seemed annoyed . our waitress seemed	1

have heard about this place for a very long time , and decided to give it a try . it certainly lives up to the hype i 've heard . i got the `` best chicken sandwich '' and decided to upgrade from the chips . the sandwich was excellent	3
the cooking <unk> and artist . i was very excited to visit this concept restaurant that brings you a surprise every course . i loved the excitement it added to the experience . my husband is very picky and the couple we dined with are somewhat vegetarian and all left	3
bueno queso ... tex mex style . i like it a lot and it is 1/2 price apps before 6:30 . our service was super slow , but overall a descent experience . i enjoyed the wild mushroom <unk> .	2

this place is great ! the ice cream is sweet , but not too sweet , creamy and delicious . their ice cream is made from local ingredients and without preservatives . you can definitely taste the difference . by default , the ice cream is healthier ... yeah ...	4

i remember going to cpk years ago -lrb- in ny -rrb- and enjoying it . but i must say i was really disappointed . we ordered a roasted artichoke & spinach pizza , but it was just ok . maybe i 'm just comparing it to picazzo 's amazing puttanesca	1

i 've been coming here for several months thanks to the suggestion of you fellow yelpers ! all i get is the breakfast burrito w no meat -lrb- potato , egg & cheese -rrb- , so i ca n't speak to their other menu items . the breakfast burrito is	3
pretty standard fare for a simon mall although i dig the addition of the outlet shops . i 'm not a mall person so i did n't over <unk> . from what i 've gathered from arizona , there are a million malls to frequent so you can always find	2
upscale version of ycs . better seasonings and sauces available -lrb- yay for curry ! -rrb- . as a vegetarian it is harder to pack all the veggies in your tiny bowl here as compared to ycs though . the drink specials are awesome !	3
came here for takeout . i was <unk> out -lrb- yes , i said <unk> out -rrb- for some caribbean food -lrb- other than my own -rrb- . and the caribbean restaurants are few and far between out here . on top of that , i 'm a veggie .	1

it 's a great asian grocery store -- but the way things are organized by <unk> is frustrating . that 's because if you are looking for something -lrb- for ex spices -rrb- there might be 4 different rows with the same thing but different countries of origin . it	3
lee lee and mekong much better . unless you need a specialized korean item , this store is a waste of time .	1
i came on wednesday havana nights on their roof top patio , so i can not speak for any other parts of this big place . there is no cover and the dance lessons are free . dance lessons were held from 7 pm - 8:30 . two latin dances	2
- great salsa , especially if you mix the red and green together ; however , the chips are only mediocre - very tasty refried beans - amazing chicken mole enchiladas . that little kick they throw in is outstanding - the enchiladas <unk> were amazing . great green chili	3
starters : - grilled artichoke : not a favorite for the table , but a definite favorite of mine . very beefy and full of flavor - grilled calamari : wow . silky smooth with a hint of the grill and the white bean ragu , which i was skeptical	3
my wife and kids love this place . it is truly an amazing warehouse of every kind of candy in every color that a kid , young or old , could dream of .	3
the broth is still just ok , but the tendon is awesome ! huge , tender , and meaty .	3
great value . the hummus and chicken are decent . the beans are extremely bland . the service was very good and the space was not as cramped as the tempe location .	2
excellent for gilbert . truly excellent . for gilbert . the sweet potato fries were excellent . the wild salmon -lrb- i should have asked from which river -rrb- was a little dry , but the seasoning was quite good . five stars for the restrooms .	2

excellent new mexican food . better than average salsa . the shrimp rellenos were full of flavor . i was expecting more heat , but ended up with more flavor , which is fine in my book .	3
i like the darker , slightly <unk> interior and somewhat intimate <unk> booths on the sides . it 's a nice environment . service is friendly and food was reasonably good . the pretzels in beer cheese sauce were really good . the burger was above average , nothing special	3
i was n't sure what to expect going on , but overall i was pretty satisfied . the tacos are well done , with lots of interesting options influenced by different cuisines -lrb- think carnitas in dr. pepper -rrb- . mexican food purists would be turned off by this place	3
we have been here twice and the first time was awesome , lots of laughs , great service , delicious food . of course , i had a few at the bar before , so everything was fun ... the next time , we had dinner on the patio .	2
i think that i will have to go back and try zinburger again and not try the buffalo chicken sandwich . my bad . i am at a burger joint and should try the burger . the sweet potato fries were good , but did not enjoy the sauce .	1
we finally made it here for breakfast/lunch and i guess we will make there again some time in the future . the wait staff was quick to greet and get us our drinks and order . after that , it was awhile before the food got to us . the	2

dirty , greasy , and cramped ... yet the place is oddly pretty trendy and popular . the waitresses are really hot . the food is pretty good , but it 's greasy and fairly typical . hearty portions served at least ... you wo n't go hungry here .	2
bless me yelp for i have sinned . it has been two and a half months since my last review . to be honest , i have n't really been going anywhere . however , i did make it to cr last week and decided to come talk about it	2
hey , let 's build a mall that will blend in with the surrounding landscape ... no , not the desert landscape , but the urban sprawl of north phoenix . this mall is huge ... a huge parking lot . you have to drive from store to store because	1
edible ... that 's how i 'll describe this food . i ate it - cleaned my plate even . i had a lunch special which was a <unk> and a slice . the slice was a `` <unk> '' as the waiter described it and swore most slices were	1
okay - i 've been going here fairly regularly and i 've upgraded this to a 5 star place . the food is awesome and the people here are rad . it 's one of my new favorites . i do n't know what i was thinking giving it a	4
fantastic place to take a visitor from out of town . the place is somewhat seasonal because you really should eat on the outside patio . it 's definitely a fun atmosphere and the food is actually good -lrb- sometimes -rrb- . i found the service to be nice as	2
this is my gym because i have an la fitness membership and it 's the nearest location to my house . i 'm locked into a deal where i pay only 99 bucks a year for life , so i ca n't really ditch it since most people pay much	2
i think i went on a bad night because i 'd say that normally the service here is a lot better than i described in my last review . they also changed the decor again . i 've since been back and was reminded that a good time can be	2
i remember as kid my older sister would drive me to one of the only gelato places in town in old town scottsdale . i do n't think this was it , but i know it 's near the same area . old town has changed so much over the	4
i 've only eaten there twice , but the food both times was very very average ... not reflected in the prices . at this price point , the food should be out of this world . the happy hour specials are decent and the atmosphere is outstanding , but	2
outstanding new restaurant in old town - looks like 3rd time 's the charm in this location . previous owner -lrb- s -rrb- had tried a few different things that apparently did n't pan out . well , the new owner of this spot apparently knows what 's up .	4
this is the only location i 've found that carries the one thing i actually like ... it 's the chicken caesar salad wrap . i love it . i 've had the same thing elsewhere , and at other places the dressing pools or drips and makes me want	3
ok - first off , i have to admit that this place had good - nay - delicious food . from pizza to pasta , boston 's did it well . that 's where the good times end . a few years ago , this place had everything going for	1
they have a chai tea drink called the himalayan hammer . it sounds like a sex position . it 's just as good as one . nuff said .	4
this is seriously the best gelato i have had outside of italy . maybe that is because it is owned and run by italians ! that should be enough , but they carry over 30 + flavours of gelato even whipping up some unique seasonal flavours such as green apple	4
oh my god . was this a win or what ? i enjoy spice and indian food a lot , but i 'm always nervous about cleanliness and getting an explosive asshole later in the evening . however , my experience at tandoori times 2 left me with no worries	4
i drove past this place soooo many times and i am now kicking myself . this is possible the best pizza i have ever had . the decor of the restaurants is amazing and they had a fantastic menu . the service was amazing ! just a great place !	4
i do n't get it ... i feel like i missed the memo . food is <unk> - i do n't care how drunk you get , you 'll still know it stinks ! rainy day margarita is my one good memory that i can take away from this place	1
always amazing sometimes the chicken is suspect -lrb- fatty -rrb- . but i love the tortillas with scream -lrb- sour cream -rrb- . i would go here more if it was closer to my house . sign up online for a free one on your bday .	3
the chix parm is the only thing worth getting . everything else is prepared too far in advance like the chix for pasta is prepared earlier and warmed up . chix parm was good just very thin . it 's a chain i should have known better .	1
solid 4.5 great lunch spot and amazing gyro .	3
i used to come here once a week but one time gyro meat was undercooked and nasty . i have n't been back since . but , the <unk> cheese with the pita is amazing .	3
i love the hot and sour soup it amazing !!!! service is always an a + + + + also lunch specials are cheap and taste great !!!	4
went for lunch after wanting to go here for months and i was impressed . i got the pan roast combo . it was filled with crab , crawfish , and lots of shrimp . it was almost like a soup but thicker . seafood in every bite . i	4
i drove past this place soooo many times and i am now kicking myself . this is possible the best pizza i have ever had . the decor of the restaurants is amazing and they had a fantastic menu . the service was amazing ! just a great place !	4
solid chicken sandwich and solid veggie sandwich . i 'm not a huge fan of the patio does n't really feel like you are outside cramped between other buildings . great happy hour and a ton of wines by the glass for reasonable prices . spicy nuts are tasty .	3
in short an unimpressive independent italian restraint in a overly italian saturated area . over the years this location has changed names and ownership many times , and i decided to give the current <unk> of this place a try . the inside has gone upscale , with <unk> on	1
it was a warm after thanksgiving friday . i was one of the lone people at the office , my hunger grew and at each attempt for food i was <unk> as many places were closed for the day . however i lucked out and found this place . cute	2

who does not like smashing someone else 's nuts and then having them clean up the mess ? this is exactly what you can do at teakwood 's . some bars of pretzels , some have trail mix , but only teakwood 's has buckets of peanuts in the shell	3
i know what i like and it does not often take me long to make up my mind on a menu , however i spent over 8 min decided and could have spent more . the reason , so many tempting items , i usually just t need to decide	3
great ambiance , good location , decent food and mediocre parking . down town had been lacking a trendy <unk> take on vietnamese food , and this nicely fills the void . the menu is full of rolls $ 4 - $ 5 <unk> mi 's $ 8-10 and pho	3
i saw the olives , however the ivy was nowhere to be seen , just like the real value . to put it simply you are paying for decore and location , the quality ingredients do not match the prices . we had a veggie <unk> $ 11 and the	2

first note the costco food court only accepts cash . with that said it takes very little cash to have a great meal . i stop in here frequently for a quick lunch or dinner . the hot dog and a soda combo is only $ <unk> with tax .	4

i returned here <unk> a birthday lunch with a co-worker . i was a bit sad to see the tuna sandwiches was removed from the menu leaving me with the $ 13 tuna plate option . it comes with two decently sized cajun pieces of tuna , on a bed	2
apparently something is healthy if you can put the words `` organic , '' `` wild , '' or `` natural '' in front of each main ingredient . at least this is what true food kitchen would have you believe . naturally i went here with a good friend	1

went here tonight , a first friday evening around 8pm . only 3 other tables were full and about 12 people in the bar . the waiter was a little slow and did n't ask to refill or anything till we were done eating ... unusual . after the $	2
this place is great for lunch if you are in a hurry . tons of seating and minimal wait time . parking is okay though you probably will have to settle for the street or dirt lot across the street . the portions are huge ! i would dare say	3

everybody raves about the carne asada and pastor , but we go for the bean and cheese burritos -lrb- no lard ! -rrb- , vegetarian quesadilla , and -lrb- for me -rrb- corn on the cob . my kids are especially crazy about the bean and cheese burritos , and	4
came here on my birthday and was not impressed . the atmosphere was nice but my husband and i were not happy with the food at all . the bread they gave pre-meal was just ok but did n't seem very fresh . there were two types of butter that	0

tried smashburger for the first time a few weeks ago . i have to say that i really enjoyed it . i ordered the arizona burger -lrb- chipotle mayo , habenero cheese , jalapenos , guac , lettuce , tomato -rrb- and sweet potato fries . the burger was spicy	3
came here with the bachelorette party for some appetizers to tide us over since dinner was not till 7:30 . managed to come right as happy hour was beginning -lrb- 3pm to 7pm -rrb- . had a couple of drinks -lrb- mango margarita was amazing -rrb- , calamari , vegas	4
i do love chino , however , i am taking off a couple of stars because the last few times i have gone there , the food didnt seem very fresh but was till tasty . i love the pork fried rice -lrb- some of the best fried rice ive	2
pretty much my favorite place for breakfast in az . . i always get the # 10 omelet -lrb- bacon , potato , green onion , sour cream , and cheese -rrb- with no potato add avocado . sooooo gooooood . this is one of the few places i order	4
got to try a few cupcakes from caketini : seasonal pumpkin spice , <unk> , and salted caramel with vanilla . the cupcakes are massive compared to sprinkles and top it cupcakes . all of them were pretty good but my favorite was the pumpkin spice which is odd considering	2
my new favorite sammich spot !!! the bread is fresh and great !!! i always get the turkey tom with extra mayo -lrb- make sure you get extra mayo or you will have a dry sub on your hands -rrb- . the hub loves the gargantuan . the only other	4
terrible service from scott h , super slow for food and drink orders . try the bar next time .	0
impromptu stop for a late lunch - sat outside on the patio with the busy scottsdale road traffic and pedestrians to watch . it 's a good thing we had some entertainment because the food was a little slow considering there were only a few people there . i had	1
great little fun place with awesome atmosphere , great coffee , <unk> , and other real good things !	3
cool place ! tvs everywhere ! music ! game room ! and ribs that fall apart in your mouth from being so moist and tasteful !	3
2nd time there in a week . very good customer service . pro 's : the salad and bread that are served with the meals is a # 1 . the salad is filled with good stuff -lrb- that costs money ... not cheap -rrb- ... and the bread ,	4
2 stars because the burgers are average -lrb- would be 3 stars -rrb- but the price for what you get is high -lrb- minus <unk> -rrb- . with that said , i probably should go back just to see . but first impressions are usually what stick .	1
i did n't think i really liked pizza , but since i 've done reviews of around 10 pizza places , apparently i do . this one -lrb- and its branches at other locations -rrb- is the best in the valley ; maybe the best one i 've ever visited	4
count on charleston 's for top-notch food , service , and ambience . i have visited this location at least a half dozen times , so i can attest to their consistency . my favorite dish is the honey lime chicken salad , which is light and tasty . it	4
these cakes are amazing ! they taste wonderful . i 've been able to sample them on two different occasions , and they 're just delicious . who would have thought something as basic as a bundt cake could be so great ? they have a great cream cheese frosting	4
went here to eat last night . my friend loves this place for their beer and really enjoys rocking happy hour . i myself do n't drink so i ca n't comment on the quality of their beer . we came in after happy hour , so the restaurant was	2
i popped into this spot with a small group of people for their `` after dinner hours '' bar set-up . the interior is very chic and they open up the side doors so that you can enjoy the amazing weather both from the inside or the outdoor patio .	1
this is where the beautiful people converge on a friday night to eat some amazing food and drink wine . i am continually entertained by the people that frequent this establishment . i have sampled salad and pizza and have yet to be disappointed ! the service is friendly and	4
i was with my coworker on a business appt in this area today and he suggested we eat lunch here . i was a little hesitant because the places he has mentioned in the past as being his usual haunts usually do n't agree with me but i was actually	2
i go to gb for the balcony and the <unk> . one a warm sunny day there are n't many places i would rather relax . watching the people on mill ave as well as the planes flying into phx can kill a few hours if you are bored .	3
best , and biggest candy store in az . . what else do you need to know !? they have almost everything you can imagine . went today & got some <unk> jelly beans for the candy dish at the office . never grow old my friends !! visit sweeties	4
easily the worst establishment in downtown phoenix . hands down . i ca n't express how badly i wish i could give 0 stars to this place . <unk> from the second we showed up to the last . i want nothing to do with the employees or the clientele	0
the best bar food in phoenix . actually , calling it `` bar food '' almost seems <unk> , this is just very tasty cuisine . hot chick sandwich , best turkey , mahi-mahi sandwich , nachos , soup - all are excellent . i did not review this place	4
after a year of debating whether to make the drive downtown for this place , i am happy to say that i finally did . i 'm sorry it was n't sooner . when you approach the entrance , you get a good feeling , unlike the rest of the	4
great happy hour and definitely my go-to spot for appetizers and margaritas . a friend recommended this place for happy hour food , but i came with low expectations , as i do with every place in phoenix . i was pleasantly surprised how good everything was for a chain	3

when zoe 's kitchen was featured on groupon , i decided to buy one and check the place out . i had the tuna sandwich -lrb- with red onions -rrb- and the potato salad . my boyfriend had the chicken marinara plate , but i ca n't remember the side	3

i 've been here a couple of times and can report : i like it ! it 's a fairly unpretentious place with good beer and a friendly staff . i 've enjoyed the <unk> beer and double ipa . they regularly invite local food trucks to plant themselves out	2
i really like this place . let 's see what we have here : tons of vinyl records -lrb- some at $ 1.00 prices -rrb- ? check . a collection of obscure <unk> rock vinyl ? check . old dudes talking vinyl <unk> ? check . weird older guy <unk>	3
i have always really liked this little dark and dingy hole in the wall for the beer only . their food is not good . there isnt anything good on the menu other than beer dont even bother with it cuz over the years my husband and i have tried	1
this is my favorite place in the valley . there is nothing that can compare to the beauty of a walk along the water here . i love to be on the north side which is the side that people rarely go to . they are missing out because its	4
tiny drinks big prices not sure about this place yet . location was really good otherwise . not worth the extra money for location . review update several days later i loved the interior but who wants to stay inside when you are on mill . it 's much more	2
i ate at this place a few times a few years ago , and this dish <unk> memorable : <unk> con chile rojo ~ just like nana used to make ... two pork chops grilled then <unk> in a spicy red chile sauce . served with rice , whole beans	3
went with a party of 8 on sunday <unk> . -lrb- we had been going to <unk> <unk> 's actually , but it was closed for renovations , so we went next door to dos gringos . -rrb- the place is really nicely decorated and `` fun '' from a	3
have to give this place some serious love . went with my <unk> son and enjoyed the place a lot . ground beef tacos - totally scrumptious . best thing we had . they do hard tacos right . pernil pork tacos - very tasty also . tender meat some	3
i must add my 5-star recommendation to this marvelous little establishment . and it is little - 5 or 6 tables . as others have said , the `` free sample '' is very tasty . and the people running the place are genuinely nice people . i had the	4
not great . barely good . tri-tip sandwich had `` tough '' tri-tip and it fell apart with the effort of trying to tear the meat during a bite . kids did n't like their burgers as well as they like in-n-out . the fries were decent , but the	1
went based on a yelp search . asked for the `` yelp deal '' and the girl gave me a `` what is that ? '' i then had to explain the offer . minus half a star . employees should know the offers , right ? not too high	3
just a quick update on something i tried on my most recent visit : the sauce served with the sweet potato fries is the best <unk> sauce i 've ever tasted . i 'd go back just for that side dish , except everything else is good also .	4
do you want an escape from your typical arizona dining experience ? do you crave an outdoor seating area were the beer flows like water and the old men dance around in traditional german clothing holding <unk> ? you really need to check this place out . i live about	4

i almost feel bad not giving 5 stars because it really was 5 star service , however , i feel 5 stars are reserved for the best of the best . -lrb- little things like valet already having your car pulled around on your way out -rrb- anyway , enough	3
yum , yum yum - i finally had a sandwich from here and my coworkers were jealous . which in all fairness i probably did on purpose . i got the market special and friday a great day . bread is round and thin and charred , and i swear	4
this place is incredible ! just about every kind of liquor you can imagine ! i love the writing along the walls as well , makes it less of a warehouse . if you are as big a wine drinker as i am than you are bound to find something	3
its good do n't get me wrong . i 've heard there is a soup to die for but i have yet to enjoy that . the sushi is great but the sushi for what it is i think is highly overpriced . 2 rolls for me for $ 30	3
the main reason i am giving 3 stars tonight was the service ! not all together but our waitress as a whole was awful ! she never came to our table during our dinner . we had to flag her down for a box and asked for the check right	2
this is such a fun relaxed place to eat !! i always sit at the bar because i totally enjoy watching them prepare everything . maybe my review wo n't be the best for most people checking this place out ... but i have never actually had a pasty but	3
best bagels in arizona !! they blueberry bagels with blueberry creme cheese is amazing !! they are fresh daily , never hard or lacking flavor . they owners are amazing and the people definitely are friendly and remember me no matter how often or little i am in there .	4
i 've been to windsor enough now to `` get it '' and to have let them address some of the observations of other customers . i 'll start off by saying that there is nothing <unk> <unk> in the place , and the concept is quite good . combined	2
had my first visit there this afternoon . very good broth in that pho . i had a large bowl of the number one `` everything '' version -lrb- complete with tripe -rrb- . the meat had been cooked long enough to be tender . the spring rolls were good	3

first of all , there is nothing wrong with this place . it 's a <unk> coffee shop that offers all the popular items at good prices . go there and enjoy . visit in <unk> with a trip to the art museum , phoenix little theatre or the main	3
the lighting . it 's the lighting . whomever did the lighting design for lucky strike deserves an award . the lighting makes the place , even more than the furniture and colors . you walk into this subdued <unk> space , totally devoid -lrb- it seems -rrb- of any	2
based on food by itself , i would have only given a two . i do n't think crepes -lrb- and i am by no means an expert crepe eater -rrb- should be tough . i do n't think they should need to be <unk> through with a <unk> knife	2
on the plus side , they : a -rrb- serve wine and beer , b -rrb- give you a place and an atmosphere to sit and talk about the movie before and after in the lounge area external to the auditorium c -rrb- give us film buffs a place to	3
an <unk> of my youth whose best times are probably behind it , sadly . i 've been there so many times for special occasions . it 's always seemed like the real core of the valley to me . the grounds and main halls are still beautiful and are	3
there are n't many places around the valley that can pull me from a distance like a <unk> of <unk> metal in the <unk> of an <unk> , but this is one of them . it 's mainly the atmosphere on the open patio , i think . or maybe	3
good bet for happy hour in the biltmore . nice menu featuring a fairly impressive margarita -lrb- even though that 's not my usual drink -rrb- . there are good prices on the food items as well , though the $ 5 chicken skewers tasted a bit <unk> , at	3
go for the happy hour , enjoy the drink specials -lrb- $ 5 martinis among others . yay ! -rrb- and order the big ass burger , but before you do remember these points : it 's open seating during happy hour -lrb- which runs 4-7 -rrb- . there were	3

my wife and i visited lgo a while back and we were both impressed and enjoyed our meal . the wings were by far the best i have ever tasted . our pizza was great , we had the pepperoni and ricotta . it does get kinda crowded and chaotic	3
i love the clubhouse . its not super tiny like some smaller venues and they tend to book bands that i want to see . the stage is not high and and there is no barrier separating you from the band which is always best . the parking is convenient	3
i love the drive in movies . its such a classic experience for such a cheap price and you get more for your money . i have not gone to the snack bar or the bathrooms so i do n't know that goes . but if you are halfway smart	4
had a nice easter brunch here today . we 've ate brunch before here , so we knew it would be good . plus it was a good choice , as it may have ended up being less than some of the easter brunches at the resorts in town .	3

it 's just too much friggin ' work to eat here . i just ca n't enjoy waiting for 3 hours to get in anywhere . you wind up at the bar next door drinking out of an <unk> to do something . but that 's no good , because	2
today is a sad day . my partner and i went to maui dog for the always good dogs and fries . they were already closed . this was one of my top 5 meals in phoenix . consistently excellent . we will miss you very much . i hope	4

take all of the stars ! i will do my best not to gush , but know as you 're reading this that i 'd gladly gush if i thought it was appropriate . to have posh listed as a restaurant is almost a travesty ... posh is an evening	4
one of my top three favorite theaters in the phoenix area for sure , i have found more gems at camelview than any other theater . camelview and valley art in tempe are really the only theaters i <unk> on a weekly basis so i do n't miss something wonderful	3

i had been patiently waiting for this place to open ! i was super excited when they did , however a little underwhelmed by some of the reviews . maybe i had hyped it up in my head too much ? but i decided to give it a go anyway	3

i really like nypd food and service . do n't sit on the patio though , they forget about you out there . i was disgusted and left from the lack of service out there . i did eventually come back because i like their food .	2
meh , it 's just a burger and soggy fries . what 's the big attraction ? menu reminds me of in-and-out .	2

nice , clean & more modern looking location here . food is pretty much the same as other locations , with parking being a challenge sometimes due to adjacent restaurants . buffet prices are n't bad , but the soda fee is a ripoff .	3
croissants ? where are they ? must be confusing with other <unk> . nonetheless we had a good dining experience here . pleasant , somewhat dark and <unk> feel to the place - very <unk> . not many beers to choose from though . spin dip was fairly good ,	3
horribly slow here with food , and some items were just downright foul -lrb- eggs in the breakfast burrito -rrb- . hot sauce in the plastic tube was good though , as well as the spicy tomatillo sauce . no real drive-thru . what the heck ?	1
movie themed in decor , with lots of booths , and overall is a throw back to a casual diner 40 + years ago . traditional breakfast favorites . nothing we had was bad , but nothing great either . worth trying .	2

any place with an habanero burger served with a glass of cold milk is my sort of place . green chile macaroni and cheese is quite tasty as well . they also have a modest selection of craft beers on tap . menu is printed <unk> a newspaper style format	3
right outside the castle boutique parking lot - so you can see what people look like who go there ! well , the windows face south so not to easily ... but anyway , the pastas were quite good and served piping hot . they have a very small bar	2
great beer , clean & modern brewpub atmosphere , and the food is above average as well . if you 're not into craft beer then you may not appreciate this place . beers are served in traditional <unk> <unk> glasses . seasonal brews offered 4-6 times per year .	3
cool theme with music along the route , but organization and execution of the start and finish are inconsistent , and sometimes very frustrating . the end location needs better access to key roads for ability to move people out of the area , and parking in downtown tempe is	2

ready to have fun and get your party on ? this is the place to be . after <unk> several events here i was impressed on how much fun i had . let me start with the bar staff . they are super busy but can hold down the fort	4
disappointed ... food was great but service and management were not up to par . i had the worst experience that no customer should ever go through . i am shocked and lost for words . 1st check-in and experience . wo n't ever return ...	1
taste buds are satisfied . i had been hearing about this place for the longest . since i had a sweet tooth carving i decided to give them a try . all i can say is that i am glad i did . wow ! what a donut . all	3
my new favorite happy hour spot ! 1/2 priced wine -lrb- with excellent options to choose from -rrb- and select appetizers from 3-6 p.m. . the cheese plate could well be one of the best in the valley . four chef selections with crostini and only about $ 8 at	3

went back to listen to <unk> <unk> perform . what a great place to hang out in the neighborhood ! -lrb- although the music started about 45 minutes later than was advertised , which would n't be as big of a deal if it was n't a weeknight ... -rrb-	3

went for lunch today and had the shepherd 's pie . a co-worker had the peppercorn burger and it looked so fancy with an onion ring and pickle skewered on top . the ambiance was more than i expected ! reserving stars until i get to go back for live	2
some highlights on the current menu : ~ buttery , moist , delicious sand <unk> -lrb- a delicate , sweet flat fish -rrb- and an ample portion . -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- ~ smokey okra , complimented by pepper jelly that is reminiscent of something you dip egg rolls in	3
wow ! they do n't skimp on the heat here . the menu 's packed with options and the service was spectacular ! sweet , hospitable , good with selection suggestions . nice wine selection . i hear happy hour is awesome - already starting to plan my next visit	3
i 'm a big fan of the beer selection and the gnocchi bolognese . it 's tough to get a drink from the bar when it 's crowded and you 're waiting for a table .	3
i really have a hard time calling pomeroy 's a dive bar and , when challenged , i ca n't completely justify why i have this struggle . sure , the tables are carved up with things like `` yelp '' and `` i am rad '' -lrb- <unk> ,	3
went here for brunch this morning -lrb- sunday -rrb- and there were a few things that diminished the experience for me : * you claim new mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any new mexican restaurant meal . *	2
it 's almost not fair to describe a specific meal here because the menu changes and you can not be assured to find whatever is described ; you can , however , be assured of finding <unk> presentation and an outstanding meal . i 've had wonderful short ribs ;	4
experience is the key word for me , when describing r + d . it 's not often you wait in a dark alley to go someplace swanky . once called , up you get a <unk> and an <unk> : `` been here before ? familiar with the rules	3
a huge fan ! but ... why is everyone just talking about breakfast !? if you reserve astor house for breakfast you are missing the best part ! the cocktails . i 'm not even kidding ! all drinks are on special 3-7 every day : progressive wine prices -lrb-	3
still a fan because i love the beer selection , and the venue . but , i want to update because the gnocchi has gotten a little <unk> . not inedible but not as impressive as it once was ... so , i guess , i <unk> my love for	3

i have yet to find a bad seat here . even the $ 25 cardinals game tickets are reasonable , though who would n't prefer to be in the $ 75 seats ? that said , food and drink pricing is beyond ridiculous ! do not come hungry ! -lrb-	3
so , i too am a pizza freak . grew up in nyc and florence italy . i have had pizza all over the world . i 'm just not seeing <unk> 's as having good pizza . first time i was looking <unk> to it , having had heard	1

i hate that they charge 75 cents to use a credit card and that they charge extra to get a flour tortilla on a taco . i have had much better tacos for less money ! i will not return .	1
i do n't understand the hype ! the bread was ok , but they use over processed <unk> ham ! i can buy that at the grocery store . their mayo tasted funny , too ! never going back !	1
not a true jewish deli . the egg salad is terrible ... so sweet . i think it is way over priced for what you get ! i will not return .	1
i do not like this place . i think it is way too salty ... especially the sausage . the pizza is just so so to me . i will not return because for the money , there are better places in the area .	1
of course , the first problem with being a regular here is that you have to tell you friends to meet you at a place called xtreme bean . it sounds like some horrible taco bell concoction . assuming you can move past the name , you might like this	2

i went here when i found out the breaking bad series <unk> was playing at tt roadhouse . it felt nice to walk into a dive bar to watch the show . you 'd think it 'd be a horrible place to watch a show like that at a bar	3
i moved here from sf in june and found an ad for this place in the mail once . it talked about these fresh drinks and delicious mongolian food . i 've had mongolian bbq before and have always been a fan . i thought i 'd give this place	3
i was here with lynn w sat night for dinner and i 've been dreaming about the food ever since . the decor is simple and clean and the space is small . this is an upscale thai restaurant and is pricier than most . they do have a lunch	4

buca di beppo will fill you up ! i have always been a huge fan of <unk> . the atmosphere in these restaurants are very fun and support the theme they are trying to represent . i really love how they tour you through the kitchen on your first visit	4
so i 've been passing by this place for sometime now , and finally i 've built up the courage to actually stop in and try it . needless to say , i would like to know where i can sign up to be a regular here ! this place	3
in theory this place is a fun concept , food , bar , outdoor playground for adults including , lounging areas , large screen tvs , games and servers to bring you whichever cocktail and snacks you desire and the bonus of valet parking . i came to join friends	1
this was my second visit in years , but first time to this location . i showed up <unk> late to attend a birthday party dinner , took a quick trip to the restrooms -lrb- liked the decor of the restaurant -rrb- and upon returning to the table was surprised	1

went here with the supper club in september for a 6:30 pm dinner . this is now one of my fave restaurants . since this place does n't serve alcohol but offers a <unk> option , one of the gals brought two bottles of white wine for our dinner .	3
very `` in crowd '' but not overly snotty . the seating is a little on top of each other but the food and drinks make up for it . they do not take reservations so be prepared for a bit of a wait depending on when you go .	3
ordered chicken club , lots of avocado which i loved . husband ordered double burger , he liked it but did n't rave about it . fries were so/so . his golden and crunchy , mine limp and kinda soggy - i 'll give it another shot before deciding if	2

cute lunch spot especially on a warm arizona day ... which is like everyday . the outdoor patio makes you feel right at home as well as the tiny birds that fly right in front of your face . i felt like i was sitting in my own front yard	2

my place for a steak anywhere and always . their service is consistently good and their food quality is top notch . in 20 plus years of dining with them i 've only had 2 mediocre steaks and both times the staff exceeded our expectations in <unk> the matter .	4
went last week for the special <unk> jewish sliders . they were so delicious . not very big though and the regular price of $ 3.99 is a little high . the side order of french fries were quite good . they were even better heated up in my toaster	3

this place is great . it really great for family meals . the food is good .	4
as always this place rocks , the new thai beef salad is so good and spicy but the big huge surprise was the big island meatloaf . if you like pig and beef mixed together with a crispy crust then get this piece of heaven .	3
i would have to say `` suprise '' is the first words that come to mind with this hole in the wall or you could say it is the crowds of people waiting to hit this joint all night . i have had better , but the food was good	2
it 's okay , it 's a fun adventure for the kids and families not for a date .	2
great place for when you want to enjoy desert views and outdoor seating . the food is nothing too challenging , southwestern takes on american favorites . -lrb- chops , chicken etc -rrb- . the desserts are a little weak here , but the meal overall can be magical .	3
good but not great . i love the architecture and the location . -lrb- right next to the venerable old , north high school , my alma mater -rrb- . i think it is just a smidge pricey for what you get . service is good . i like the	2
best sticky toffee pudding ever . but before i jump to dessert may i say that this restaurant is a feast for the eyes as well as for a hungry belly . the bread and olive oil is a good way to start . the polenta is delicious , i	4

you can really tell the sushi room uses fresh quality ingredients . there are great happy hour specials each night . rolls are $ 4-5 . i tried a few different rolls but the vegas roll was my favorite . the atmosphere is trendy and a little more upscale .	4
the museum is medium sized . you can get through the museum in <unk> .5 hours if you go at a moderate pace . the phoenix art museum is free every wednesday after 3pm and every first friday of the month . that being said , i normally do n't	2

if you want an atmosphere of <unk> and jersey wearing monotony this is your place . this is not my place . as usual , they make up for the lack of decor and intimacy with very competitive drink specials and food items . their service very personal 5 *****	2
the employees at this location are sooo nice ! even when it 's super busy they are still very friendly . my favorite thing about this place is it 's open 24 hours ! if you want breakfast for dinner or a milkshake at midnight you can have it !	3
after hearing all the hype i was very excited to shop here . for me it did n't live up to the hype . i thought the women 's clothes were okay but nothing i could n't live without and the men 's clothes were a little too fashion forward	2

great atmosphere and great food . i ate dessert after eating at what was once open , trader vics . the dessert here was great . i had the special , the chocolate <unk> pie . this was a very good choice . i will come back here for dinner	3
i had high hopes for this restaurant . however , they ended once i was greeted at the door by a very unfriendly hostess . i had a reservation and had made it over a week in advance . well , we arrive 10 minutes prior and are seated at	1

huge airport . not as modern or clean as lax or <unk> , but good nonetheless . lots of little gift shops inside for tourists to buy knick knacks but my suggestion would be to pass through security first because the stores on the `` inside '' have better stock	2

lots of yogurt flavors ! lots of toppings ... they even had lychee ! i was impressed . not too impressed that my roomie and i got there at the same time as a huge sorority but i guess thats expected given the location .	4

i did n't think i would like this place , because i had the idea in my head that paying for ramen at a restaurant was a waste of money . i mean , you can buy a packet of ramen for $ <unk> and make it yourself at home	3

went to los olivos for the first time today to get my car washed . i usually just do it myself at the self service places , but i had gone on a few road trips with my dog and she left a lot of hair in the back seat	1
this place is good , but it 's not good enough to make me recommend it over the other better restaurants out there . when a restaurant has prices for food like they do , i expect to enjoy everything i eat . unfortunately , that 's not the case	2
the duce is a really unique place to hang out with friends . they have an eclectic mix of attractions like a boxing ring , random vintage exercise equipment , a dj station , drink carts , a milkshake counter . i came here in december for brunch and it	3
i 'm not sure who <unk> who , but 5th and wine 's bruschetta appetizer is pretty much exactly the same as postino 's bruschetta ... but not as good . 5th and wine has fewer options to select from for toppings and their bruschetta costs more for less food	2
i wo n't be coming here anymore . the food does n't make up for the <unk> service . i called about a week and a half ago to make a reservation for 10 people on their patio . the girl who answered the phone took down my information but	0

although my hubby would award it 2.25 stars , i am not as harsh . i loved my belgian wit . it was like four peaks peach ale minus the peach . very refreshing ! we got potato nachos and they were different because they were cooked in their brick	2
i would have given this place one star , but the free cookie deserved an extra star . the snickerdoodles are chewy and delicious . as for the rest of the food , it was not worth the money or the calories . we saw this place on an old	1
definitely a cooler dive bar that i 've been to . the place is dark but has a lot of seating . we got free tickets to see the main band , otherwise the cover would have been $ 10 , which is somewhat expensive considering the bands were ok	2

great pizza with fresh ingredients . but no <unk> taste as they claimed and the prices are a little on the high side for freshly made pizza . great service from our server , kind of made up for an overpriced appetizer of olive oil and bread .	2
great calzones , good pizza selections . their ambience is nothing to shout about if you are eating there . but i am more concerned about taste so its fine , we sat in their back area when they had renovations once . its like u are seated on the	3
great food , great service , very interesting menu with many many choices . price was decent , only complain might be the place is a little too small and gets busy very quickly . in fact , go there at opening time to get a seat and get served	4

tucked away behind historic buildings and located a couple hundred feet from the sight of the original phoenix china town stands a local restaurant that has been part of the city since the <unk> . for that reason , i think everyone should try this place at least once .	2

there are so many great thai places in my neighborhood and this one can be added to the list . i went during their opening week and they had a screaming deal for a huge lunch special . it cost 7 bucks and some change and included a free drink	4
only tried on beef taco , but not too great . the shredded beef did n't seem shredded , it seems more mushy and chopped . the taco shell was crispy , but <unk> greasy at the bottom , which is typical , but this was too much grease .	1
this was the second time i visited for their late night happy hour . it starts at 8pm and includes a bunch of very good $ 4 appetizers and $ 3 well drinks and craft beers and $ 4 margarita 's . my food choices were two sliders on pretzel	3
tried the veggie pizza roll this time . this thing seemed bigger than usual as it filled the pizza box both length and height wise . the fillings were all pretty fresh including mushrooms , tomatoes and olives . no ricotta in a roll , but plenty of mozzarella cheese	4
nothing special here . only stopped inside because mexican place had closed down already next door . the sliced chicken breast wrap was average , good in a pinch , but nothing i would ever go out of my way for . it had semi sliced chicken heated with salsa	2

situation is much better at 10am when the games begin . plenty of room at the bar and make sure you ask for the iowa <unk> breakfast menu . that menu contains the best deal in the house - the $ 9 breakfast burrito . i substituted bacon for sausage	3

well , i rolled up around 5pm and there was plenty of street parking available . seems like a bunch of famous <unk> restaurants have been plopped down in residential areas - very strange . happy hour runs to 6pm only , so i slipped in three craft beers -lrb-	3
back to sample happy hour fare . the domestics were only $ 2.75 and the hh food menu is quite extensive . it also is one of the only happy hours that <unk> until 8pm . my food choice was the chicken skewers and these were solid if you like	4

the fresh tortilla thing is pretty cool and the fact that they use all white meat chicken is a huge plus , but the chicken is not marinated as stated . not a huge fan of the mix all the ingredients together in the burrito before you roll it thing	2

so , sweet republic lived up to the hype . i mean seriously , so good . if you like ice cream , you have to try this . the shop is small , clean , and the staff is helpful . the cherry chocolate chip is full of chunks	4
i am from texas and i do love the regional food . my husband had been craving a good chicken fried steak , so we decided to try texaz grill . the parking can be a pain . if you pull into the spots right in front of the building	3
yummy ! veggie egg rolls are excellent - really interesting , complex flavor . egg flower soup is full of vegetables and is a lot heartier than i expected . lemon chicken is pretty good - not terribly exciting , but not bad by any means . the ma po	3
cute , little shop with lots of interesting and unique jewelry , clothing , gift items , etc. . it 's fun to walk around and look at the different stuff . i think the prices are too high for what you get , but it 's fun to window	2
what a great place . i stopped in with some friends for happy hour -lrb- 4:00 <unk> , i believe -rrb- . each night has different specials ; we were able to enjoy half priced house wine and well cocktails . our server was really friendly and the restaurant is	3
* update * this was originally a four star review -lrb- i deducted a star only because you have to pay an extra $ <unk> to sub <unk> milk in your latte ! -rrb- , but i had to change it . i love giant so very , very much	4
$ 5 martinis and $ 5 manicures on mondays !!! the <unk> teaches at a school , so - needless to say - the manicure was great . the drinks were good . the bartender stayed on top of us , but also out of our way . the atmosphere	4
i love me some <unk> ! it is hands down my favorite chill lounge in downtown phoenix . the crafty cocktails and small bites are perfect to help unwind after work . the music is chill and even on the weekends you can have a conversation because the music is	4
i am blessed to have a sunflower <unk> walking distance of my salon and another within bike riding distance of my house . i love this place ! i usually get my lunch from here a few times a week and it fits into my budget nicely . i usually	4
totally disappointed on so many levels with this place . i went there last night excited to finally try the place since i drive past it on my way to and from work everyday . when it is all lit up at night it just seems so inviting . i	0
i have been a patron of kyoto for 15 years , in fact went on a really bad date there when i was 21 . even though the date was painfully bad it did n't ruin my taste for kyoto . now i love sushi and have been to many	3
i love this place ! we 've never been to greece or have had `` authentic '' greek food at a fancy restuarant but i have had <unk> and gyros and new york city so i 'm basing my comparison on that and i think this place is pretty awesome	3
i would say compared to other <unk> and movie theatres , it 's about par . we 've been coming here for a few years now and like that it 's in a shopping center area . it 's easy to just get a meal and then head to the	2
my husband 's been wanting to try this place so we decided to check it out on one of our trips into phoenix . very friendly staff , simple menu , very delicious food . i ca n't really explain what the sandwiches are like . you just have to	3
love coming here . great service , neat little grocery area -lrb- more eclectic stuff than actual groceries -rrb- , and the food is awesome -lrb- simple menu but delicious -rrb- .	4
it has been a while since i 've been here . you know the place is good when you have n't gone in a couple of years and they 've expanded !! this place is just as good now as it was before . we enjoyed the shredded beef with	3
root beer is delicious . service is very good . it 's hidden <unk> in the back of a strip of stores so you wo n't see it driving by . enjoyed or meals .	2
my first experience here was an ok one . it was on a day when there was a live jazz band playing , which were phenomenal . since moving to the area carly 's bistro has become one of my local favorites . i find myself coming back time and	3
sit ... stay and you wo n't be disappointed . short leash takes a great american pass time food , the hot dog , and turns it into a dining experience to not miss out on . their gourmet style hot dogs will thrill your taste buds in the moment	4
this little gem in downtown phoenix is easy to overlook . located in what appears to be another house in a residential area but is actually a quiet italian restaurant . the place is nestled behind a row of trees that afford some privacy for the patio diners . the	3
this outdoor mall located in tempe is amazing ! pros : almost every store you could wish for , great variety from food to clothes to coffee and tea . or if you prefer catch an afternoon matinee . con : parking lot is confusing and during christmas season stay	3
i know everybody loves this place and it does have a nice charm . i really appreciated that in december they were not playing christmas music during my meal ! i have eaten here a few times and while i enjoy my meal for me it 's nothing spectacular .	2
no country for old buffet . the banter over tapas will never end just as my love for sens with their `` infusion '' of different asian styles and ingredients . the tofu , the cold duck , sweet & sour soup and fried quail were amazing . add to	4
i also tried the beef tacos and chilaquiles and they were fantastic . the chilaquiles can be made to order with your choice of meat and sauce . since this place opened , i think i 've been to la tolteca or chico 's grill only once .	4
a movie theatre with a lounge in downtown phoenix ? i think scottsdale -lrb- i mean hell -rrb- just <unk> over . this is great venue for watching an independent flick while enjoying your favorite brew and japanese snack . i ca n't wait to visit again because i 've	3
i do n't know what the hype is all about . i was n't impressed . a. the location is awkward . walk inside this weird building and then walk through a second set of doors to get to actual restaurant . it 's slightly off the beaten path so	2
i like this place . the boyfriend does n't . he 's partial to harkins . but i prefer this theater because it 's typically pretty empty and we do n't have to listen to bratty kids talking through the whole movie . we 've been here a couple times	3
by far one of the best mexican places downtown . their menu is not just burritos with american cheese like the other typical so called `` mexican '' places around the corner . their chef has great traditional plates that you will find within the colonial belt in central mexico	4
great food here , i am having a guilt trip not giving them a full 5 stars . stop by and have breakfast , lunch or dinner , they do n't disappoint . i love their bloody mary 's ! i love scotch too .	3
great little place that reminds me of one of my favorite places in downtown los angeles -lrb- see review for <unk> -rrb- . this place is not your typical sushi place it definitely is small and seating is tight , no teppan tables . remember to byob and even though	3
the service here is not the problem , nor is the the <unk> of tv 's -lrb- quite impressed with the fireplace screen -rrb- it 's the bad food . how can you mess up nachos and pretzels ? they serve these appetizers with a bland cheese and the salsa	0
i am always up to try new chinese places but most of times i have been disappointed . my friend invited me to lunch and said this place was one of the best and despite the <unk> degree weather outside , this place was great . we ordered fried wontons	3
another review started the beginning of december ... i 'm seriously falling behind ! server was great ... crab cakes were ice cold inside ... gm chris was awesome . tried his best to make it right but i have a strict ` do n't eat sent back food '	1
fantastic	4
second time for dinner ... if you 're in the area , give it a try but not worth driving for . the food was good but not great ... food came out fast but drink service was extremely slow and this was on a thursday night with only 3-4	2
pretty typical mongolian grill joint where they cook the food in front of you . large variety of tofu , meats , and vegetables to pile into your bowl . many different choices of sauces to pour over your items . if you go for dinner , you will get	2
my family loves getting pizza from here . very nice new york style pizza . they have pretty good wings and garlic knots also .	2
very good burgers , fries , and shakes . other people have said they have good steak and cheese sandwiches . parking situation is not very good .	2
the food here was n't horrible but the service sucked and was very slow . it took over an hour to get our food once seated . stay away from the pizzas ... they are like dense cardboard . the burger was pretty good but overpriced for what it was	1
not good . waited 15 minutes to order and 25 minutes for food . brisket was like chewing leather and was almost cold . mac and cheese were nothing special . cornbread was more like ice cold yellow cake . i do n't know what kind of low grade bbq	0
the food and service here are good . try the pizzas . my favorite is the pork pibil . i would probably give them 5 stars but they got rid of my old favorite item from the menu -lrb- carne adovada -rrb- . they brew some good beer too .	3
wow . . a waiting line on a friday afternoon means somethings good here . . i was not disappointed . love it all . . the <unk> plate is amazing , service it top notch i will be back . . chips and salsa alone are like crack .	4
love love love the food ! service no so much . . i went with a small group of lady friends during lunch hour , food was great menu was stellar with lots of options that were unique twists on old time classics . . however the services was lacking	4

wonderful family-owned restaurant . good food , good service , relaxing atmosphere . mondays were a little slower than other nights so this became my dinner , class prep , read , grade papers spot . i loved the turkish coffee and chatting with the fam . they 're also	3
how many times have you been seated at a table in an interesting , well reviewed or recommended restaurant , been handed a menu and went about selecting your meal ? have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes ? wanted to know what goes into getting food	3
saint francis of <unk> may be the patron saint of animals and the environment but after a recent visit , i wonder if st francis neighborhood restaurant in central phoenix can live up to it 's namesake . i 'd heard several things about this little restaurant near camelback road	2

this place is awesome for a healthy and delicious lunch ! prices are reasonable for how good and fresh the food is , and i find the portions to be spot on . the danish salad is out of this world yummy ! i do n't really like the dressing	4
i came in here for lunch during the work week and found it to be a nice place to get away from work for a little while ... open patio , big floor to ceiling glass windows , nice lighting . service was pretty good , not the fastest to	3

my wife , son and i always enjoy this location .	3
they have a good happy hour on sundays . sushi is pretty good but i did n't like the nachos .	2
their food is authentico italiano . i loved the arancini to start and my tortellini was homemade and unbelievably excellent . i will come back during happy hour for their deal that includes a bottle of wine . fox restaurants are always a high standard .	4
now also my favorite burger when i want one that tastes like homemade that is packed with that grilled flavor and fresh ingredients , especially the thick and crunchy pickles . i was given a taste of the salted dulce de leche shake and it was fantastic !	4
good , decent burger but wanted medium rare and got medium instead . the server tried to confirm my request for medium rare when ordering as if i do n't know what it means , but it came out over anyway . onions were pretty good : nice and crispy	2

nice to have downtown but hit and miss , inconsistent quality . dishes are mostly too sweet . more savory options would make this place more appealing . either quality at this location is slipping or i have gotten bored with average <unk> asian dishes .	2
please come to downtown phoenix !!!! this place is consistently fantastic .	4
expensive . the deli needs a lot of work . their pastas and deserts are way too overpriced for the quality . chocolate mousse tasted like whipped cream with <unk> 's syrup blended in . overcooked cold large prawns were so bad i had to return the item .	1
100 % predictably good food that is bad for you ; the taste is worth the splurge of calories and fat . delicious consistently .	4
great addition to downtown .	4
good food good time	3
consistently a perfect carwash . but their complete detail ? best in phoenix hands down . you will not recognize your car when you get it back . it is like having the same car the day you picked it up from the showroom . fantastic staff and business !	4

got together with arlin b. for a first visit to this chompie 's today & went with their `` soup ! sandwich ! & slaw '' special that included kreplach soup , a big half pastrami on rye and a cup of cole slaw . this big place was comfortable	3
i 've been eating here from time to time , but wow , it 's been 20 months since my review . better give them an update ! i 'm happy to report that hong kong here has been consistently good all this time , & they have n't increased	4
i do n't really do the whole `` hang out at a coffeebar '' type thing , so my review is based only on the drink itself , which has been awesome every time i 've been there . best in the valley . it 's a shame central is	4
i love bevmo . huge selection of wines . huge selection of beers . huge selection of liquors & spirits . pretty much anything kind of accessory you could want for a <unk> party . reminds me a lot of <unk> 's back in chicago .	4
a dude playing irish music on a <unk> in a bar in north phoenix ? count me in . this is a pretty good <unk> place with your traditional attempt at <unk> -lrb- stew , shepherd 's pie , bangers & mash -rrb- with a few irish beers -lrb- guinness	3
oh man , if you do n't especially like your heart -lrb- or at least can justify it by working out after -rrb- , this is an awesome place . i 've been extremely skeptical of `` chicago '' places here in the valley , because most are bad impressions	3
in a word : superior . long live los compadres !	4
the vegan gods have spoken and have <unk> : `` let there be green '' . far and away the best vegan place between los angeles and east st. louis , green is beyond awesome . the buffalo chicken wing & samosa appetizers <unk> original po ' boy sandwich ?	4
i ca n't eat here anymore . the food is fine and the bagels are the best in town . the shit attitudes and poor service kill it . fuck chompie 's !	0
i love the salsa ; plenty of garlic and no green chilies . i pick up to-go containers all the time , and it gets hotter and tastier the longer is sits in the fridge . this is the kind of mexican place where everything is fried . there 's	3
this place is pretty tasty and has great happy hour specials ! the 2 high lights of my visit , imo , were the awesome chorizo mac 'n' cheese and sitting on the small but nice patio . my chicken nachos were good too but i just kept stealing my	3
got back from the state fair earlier tonight . ugh , food coma . i had deep-fried everything : oreo 's , cheese curds , funnel cakes , corn dogs ... and a grilled corn that was drenched in butter . it was all delicious and since i split everything	3
ok so ... this place is cool . i love the idea of it but , might want to try it again because when boba tea i ordered was ... interesting . not something i 'd <unk> actually . my friend liked his tea a lot though ! there are	2
tasty fro-yo and super fresh toppings ! wish i 'd have logged into yelp to see their special offer ... oh well . $ <unk> an ounce here ... bit more than other places but i 'm sure it 's because of the location . see ya there !	3
got beer ? no ? need specialty beer ? this bevmo might be your spot . there have been more than a couple of times when a seasonal specialty was at the end of it 's run and my roommate can only find it at this location . of course	3
delicious ! joe 's is the best bbq that i tried in az . . i loved all their selections because they have something for everyone , from ribs to giant baked potatoes . there is really not much i can say that the other reviewers have ' t said	4
a friend took me here for an early dinner a couple of months back , just to show me the place . it has a super cool atmosphere that he thought i 'd like ... and a cheese and pretzel fondue appetizer . well , it was pretty freaking fun	3
if i did loved this place ... so easy going , different for everything i had have ... a must go in san diego ... so good	3
the gym area is big , but has a really limited amount of machines and free weights , you get bored very soon <unk> same things . is always clean , that 's the good thing , but their costumer services is one of the worst , they also over	0
modern and clean facilities and generally decent customer service . in my many times through here , it has always been very easy to get from point a to point b.	3

great mall with plenty of stores and a decent food court .	3
when trying to decide where to meet some friends for dinner , cornish pasty was suggested and i <unk> agreed . i had read great reviews , so was happy to finally visit for myself . the food was great - worth a four or even a five star review	2
after having been in a few times for nothing more than beers and hummus , i finally had dinner here and it was great ! the vegetarian <unk> was to die for - extremely flavorful and well put together . i 'm not really adding anything new by raving about	3
the company my wife works at had a christmas party at casa <unk> @ el chorro . neither my wife , nor i , were impressed . the food is perhaps not what we like . food was a little too plain , and little too run of the mill	1
have gone to lalibela a few times 1 -rrb- 1st time with my mother and wife . the food was good . we are all familiar with ethiopian food . maybe the food was a bit americanized , as we have eaten ethiopian food elsewhere in the usa . we	2

i order takeout from here all the time , love the place . is it like flying to hawaii and popping into your favorite grind house ? nope . is the food delicious and satisfies your cravings for hawaiian bbq ? heck yes , honestly you can not go wrong	3

i was in the area and asked a friend if they had good soup , and he replied . . `` the <unk> '' is good . i did n't know what a <unk> was , but i decided to go anyways . . while i looked over the menu	3
it may be busy , it may take a little time getting your food , but if you have a full hour for lunch or in the mood for dinner , it 's never a bad choice . they have everything from vietnamese sandwiches and soups to delicious smoothies and	3
tried the carne asada torta , it was excellent ! taco 's were great and although i cant remember what the kids had , i know they enjoyed it . the family has been back a few times without me since our first visit . looks like it 's going	3
went this afternoon with about 15 of my co workers . lots of great food and drinks to go around . i had a chicken salad that was great ! and the assorted dishes around the table all looked fantastic . the service was excellent as was the atmosphere .	3

bj 's is a great place for hanging out . the first thing i noticed about the restaurant is that it 's really spacious and has a brewery ready for viewing . customer service is friendly and attentive . i enjoyed my beers with the family and overall there was	4
always as a fan of any costco location . my most recent costco discovery is that you can order photos online for <unk> pickup at 13 cents each . since costco beats the nearby target in customer service i will be picking up my photos from here from now on	4
great addition to the area ! north scottsdale needs more quick and easy lunch places like which wich . we had lunch there a few days after it opened . the place was packed , but the manager helped move the line along by explaining how the ordering system worked	3
more bells and <unk> than five guys , better meat than in n out , and more options than the habit = i 'm loving smashburger ! tried it for the first time when i was killing time in the tempe marketplace before a flight . i was craving sweet	3
i prefer going to this location of macayo 's over the others because of the ambience . it 's way different than the others and it does n't `` feel '' like the other macayo 's . this one is much more festive . it has a ton of patio	4
always heard the advertisements for this place on the radio . was given the impression it was a real hip place to go . well , when you see the outside , the big cadillac and the entrance with all the license plates , you think you 're in for	1
great place to meet up with friends and have a bite or drink . it 's your typical sports bar food . we have n't tried their specials yet , so will post again after that experience .	2
just is n't very good . i do n't understand why people give this place even three stars . it 's rare for me to give a place a low rating , but , my big fat greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to	0

this place has been my mainstay while going to asu for 3 years and i guess i 've forgotten to review them for awhile ~ their selection of korean food is much better then lee lees or mekong and since they feed from the asiana chain in california they seem	4
man happy birthday to me i came for the $ 10 off birthday deal that joe 's offers and came away with much more first of the location is around some <unk> and something you do n't see too often in arizona . ordering was quick and they have electronic	3

i really wanted to like this place more . chicken fingers were excellent . the problem lies in everything else . there are only four choices on the menu and all are just variations of the same thing . no salads and only one sandwich . the french fries are	1
my wife 's work had their christmas party here last night . although the customer service was slow and average at best , the food was outstanding . i had a burger and my wife the steak salad . i was the dd , but my wife said the margaritas	4

beautiful location ! this fry 's has everything , food , pharmacy , books , electronics a fred <unk> jewelry store , starbucks and us bank . even covered parking !	4
our go to pizza place ! do n't see how they could improve in any area . customer service is excellent , <unk> clean and the food is perfection !	4
first experience with <unk> . parking is super close to the terminal , security was fast and efficient . overall a great experience for such a small -lrb- but growing -rrb- facility .	3
why did it take me so long to try this place ?! well , it 's because there is almost always a line out the door . but now i understand why . the restaurant is tiny , but they can turn tables relatively quickly , and the food is	4
this place is supposed to be all about the tacos and between the meat choices and tortilla choices i think you could have around 10 different tacos , but they are traditional tacos with just meat , onions , and cilantro inside of 2 small tortillas -lrb- corn or flour	3
i got a taste of the braised beef sandwich at yelp in bloom and today was my first chance to try it in its full glory . there was no way i should 've finished the whole thing . but i did , and true to the sample from yelp	3
being from california , i was hesitant to try sushi in arizona . i mean , how fresh could it be ? well , i 'm glad i did because it was really fresh and really delicious here . the variety of food that you can order here is so	3
it 's a chain restaurant with a salad bar . the salad bar happens to be my favorite thing about this place and in my mind , it 's only redeeming quality . their burgers and <unk> items are just ok . i 'm still upset that they no longer	2
i keep going here . i do n't really know why . i think maybe they 're using an addictive chemical that makes me crave it <unk> ! better than the one on university . delicious salty chips and 2 different salsas . <unk> sodas . average tacos -lrb- the	3
if you walk out of this place and you are not happy you need to see a <unk> . probably best people in town -lrb- i know people love to debate that -rrb- . but if you love bj 's pizza newport beach , this is the place to go	4
very good place . nice romantic ambience . great wines , and good food . small parking area , but okay . good place to meet with your business clients .	3
i remember when i used to sit with proprietor david l. at biltmore <unk> -lrb- not cpk , you freak -rrb- and listen to him get passionate about this <unk> bakery concept thing where he could use the best ingredients and still make it inexpensively . willo bread was born	1

bland , uninspired , boring and dark . great happy hour spot . do n't miss spicy mary . -- light provided by a cluster of 4 <unk> <unk> <unk> and candles goes for a sidewalk cafe , but it was just too dark . -- chicken gumbo uninteresting --	1
water shipped from back east makes this a crust worth the wait . order a big salad to share and have a `` tasty beverage '' ... or two ! while you wait for it . i do n't care that this one 's a chain . it 's probably	3
i 've been several times . on a weekday night , they struggled with staffing . the waitress never came by . when i say never , her job was order and deliver only . not a check on us or refill . after being done for 15 minutes ,	2
the decor is great . the burgers are cooked nicely to order . it 's a nice place to grab a quick burger and fries . right off central you have to look closely to find . the lunch crowd gets busy .	3
what is going on ? tonight out of rolls for <unk> sandwich , the substitute stale . <unk> bbq chicken salad had the worst rubber chicken . you will lose customers if you serve that rubber chicken . ick . this was a take out order . just makes me	0
always good . dan dan noodles a spicy favorite .	3
this place can be a bit crowded . they dissapointed me on st. <unk> day by selling out of soda bread by noon . hello - ! <unk> ' irish girls need bread too ! however the blueberry <unk> <unk> waffles with orange spread instead of butter make up for	2
this place lacks in atmosphere , but makes for it in price , location , and great food !!!!	2
5 stars for <unk> the only bar in phoenix where i was first scared to order a drink . but - thats why i love this place . that , and its near the trunk space .	4
we live really close , so two thumbs up for walking to the reasonably priced non dive bar . the restaurant wants to be the vig w / kids -lrb- valet service , arcadia ladies with tacky <unk> and <unk> bags -rrb- but ends up being a sort of applebees	2
<unk> kids ... yes , the hours are not the best for night <unk> - agreed . but i 'm also <unk> that scottsdale opted out . i live in arcadia and by the time i make it to <unk> washington , i could have driven to scottsdale fashion square	2
so this is a 2.5 star review kids . great parking , great hike , great view , friendly people . but come on ! the trail signage is pretty bad and <unk> . my friend and i are decently experienced hikers and we got lost twice . a 3-5	1
well , we hit this place up with a guest from out of town . richardson 's is usually our stop , but you know it burned down : -lrb- ... everything was great , except the service . the service was sort of not with it , but she	2
service is decent , food is just okay , and location is a little hard to find if you do n't know what you 're looking for . it 's a crazy fun place during happy hour - voted one of the best in phoenix .	2
i 'll be honest ... i 'm not a food connoisseur , but i know a good chicken fried steak . theirs is similar to how my mom makes it , and wow the portions are huge . and for the price ? you just ca n't beat it .	4
love the outdoor patio . sat out there on sunday with a few girlfriends , had a couple drinks . the bloody mary is huge ! great drinks , good prices , and excellent service . i ca n't remember our waitresses name , but she was a cool <unk>	4
my favorite chai ever ! they source it from nico 's in boulder , co which is where i first had it . love the spicy ginger . espresso latte is smooth and strong as well . a + service . friendly and smart !	4
it 's not a buffet , just the regular dim sum carts . not very bustling and had to wait around a bit for carts -lrb- not slow , just not <unk> like it is at busier places -rrb- but i like their sticky rice and pineapple buns a lot	2
beers are so so . it has been hit or miss in my experience . some batches are tasty , others are awful . the food is pretty much terrible here , even for bar food . i would recommend zipps over this fare <unk> . the ambiance is great	1
can not say enough about this place . the food is delicious and all dairy free . the staff is really nice and helpful . did i mention that the food is delicous ? sunday brunch is a treat and they seem to be super busy . go support local	4
yummy vegan treats ! not the most healthy but tasty and meat free .	4
if you havent been here then i am sorry . the food is beyond description and requires that you eat it before we can talk in any detail about its yum factor . let it be said that the royale with cheese it a masterpiece . excellent choices for beer	4
i was sad when ken cheuvront closed the doors here to keep his place at phx sky harbor , but pizza people is a welcomed replacement ! the first thing you need to order is one of their mac n cheese selections . whoa . i love the spicy buffalo	4
fun to hangout here during sunday football ! also fun place to watch baseball games on tv . it can get pretty busy before the phx teams have home games , but other than that it 's pretty decent . they have great specials on sunday <unk> on beer ,	3
one of my favorite dt phx joints ... ever . i 've been here several times and have always had an amazing experience . cute place , friendly staff , quick service , excellent food ... i mean , i could n't possibly ask for anything more . the first	4
their beef gyro 's are delicious ! great portions for what you pay . and their falafel is really good too . not a great portion it seems for an order of hummus , we got like one piece of pita . just did n't seem to be much there	2
i am a big fan of sonoran dogs ! i like the ones from here because they put cabbage on the dogs . the feel of the restaurant is cute ... nothing special ... you order , you sit down , eat , and get out ! it 's pretty	3
i really wanted to love malees and i did for a period of time when the desert ridge location was open and they were serving thai food . but it seems that the menu went from the classics of thai cuisine to some strange <unk> fusion which was trying harder	0

the last few times we have been here , we 've sat upstairs at the bar . franco has always been our server so the last time we were there i asked him how long he had been working there - 35 years was the response . kudos franco .	2
love love love this place . we have been frequenting this place for about 10 years . it is a neighborhood staple . the food is always consistent , as is the service . the menu is small : steaks , chicken , shrimp , etc. . they are famous	4
we were excited to move into the neighborhood and find a bar and grill so close to our house ! that was <unk> . they have an outdoor patio , but no service . let me rephrase with the longest <unk> sentence ever : they start out serving you and	1
great restaurant/lounge on 7th street . i 've only had apps there as the food is not my fav -lrb- my taste buds only -rrb- . crystal , the new bartender , is awesome ! she is right on top of drinks , food , everything ! i 'm sure	3
these are the world 's greatest donuts . they had quite a few locations in the las vegas area years ago that all of a sudden closed once i got hooked . when i was <unk> to scottsdale i could not believe that i had location within a few miles	4
great food . plenty of football . awesome prices , chill atmosphere . best cheese fries in the neighborhood .	3
after a wonderful meal over at lgo pizzeria , my group and i wandered over the grocer that 's attached to the restaurant . i believe i may have actually been floored by just how cool and fun this little grocery <unk> was . it did n't really matter that	3
do n't take this the wrong way , i really do like this place . my only problem with it is that i get a distinct sense of <unk> from it . see , it 's called `` unlimited coffee '' . key word being ` unlimited ' . the	2
now , i 'm not an expert on thai cuisine . i 'm not an expert on anything really . but i know what i like . in this instance , i like this place . wild thaiger is located a few blocks north of the heard museum . as	3

how can you not love a burger place where everything is fresh ! no freezers and a burger only costs $ 2 !!!! this location is great . they have a drive-thru that goes very fast . often they have a person waiting to take your order instead of yelling	4
the best fast-food style pan-asian cuisine in town . but the quality is really fresh . everything is <unk> made to order so you do have to wait but dishes are piping hot !! you order at the front and they give you a number that you take to your	3

if you 're looking for chinese groceries , this is the place for you . they do sell korean groceries ; however i would recommend asiana on dobson instead . the market is fairly large : they have produce , vegetables and meat in the back . lots of parking	3
sugar crusted brioche buns were delicious and they have macaroons in large and mini sizes . this was my first time eating a macaroon . i selected the caramel flavored one after being told it was the '' original '' -- so i was easily convinced . it was yummy	4

my wife and i like to go to d & b because we signed up for the online mailer and get lots of coupons . we always have a good time . their happy hour specials are good , and half-price wednesday is a great value -lrb- but take note	3
total wine and more is a liquor mecca . all kinds of <unk> and <unk> under one roof , it 's beautiful . the best part is , the prices are great too . i can get a <unk> bottle of johnny <unk> black label for $ 19 sometimes ,	4
quite impressed . i wish their prices were a little lower , but the sushi room delivers in every other way . the service is fantastic , the atmosphere is terrific , and the food is outstanding . we had received some gift cards and could n't wait to use	4
this store is one that is staying open most are closing down . open pretty late and it 's pretty busy all the time it 's , so maybe if you 're in the area you can pop in just grab something on your way home to sway the store	2

they have any kind of candy you would ever want ! last time i was here i saw chocolate covered grass hoppers lol !	4
they no longer serve the delicious cinnamon rolls and the service was kind of lacking last time i was there . this used to be our favorite downtown breakfast spot but i 'm not sure if its worth the drive from chandler now .	2
this is a nice chinese restaurant in terms of decor and style . i do n't typically see chinese restaurants like this around here and it 's a nice change . beautiful wallpaper , nice linen tables , plenty of tables and booths all with a casual atmosphere : 5	2

this is one of my favorite pf chang 's locations because the decor looks different than the one at arrowhead and the one at keirland commons in scottsdale . the decor is very unique compared to the other ones . i love the tall ceilings and floor to ceiling windows	3

i have been to this oregano 's a bunch of times now and love the food ... you will want to come early for dinner it 's always really busy ... the staff is always friendly and will seat you as fast as they can ... i always order something	4
i had gone to this place right after guy was there and i ordered the # 1 combination 3 tacos server with rice and beans i picked a carne asada , lengua and a <unk> ... i remember not being so blown away i was really disappointed . so fast	2
i am a meat eater so when someone told me about this mock chicken sandwich i had to try it . we arrived to a pretty packed house it looked like a pretty hip crowd of people . everyone was really friendly and nice we both ordered the secret bbq	3

i have gone to this spot a few times now it 's always really busy at lunch ... it 's really loud in the restaurant i found it hard to order . i ordered the bacon cheeseburger toppings a. 1 .  steak sauce , jalapeno peppers , green peppers	3
jimmy john 's is an interesting place . it 's tucked in between the new five guys and the fat tuesday and they offer free smells . so at least there 's that . the staff is exceedingly friendly and always greet you when you enter . you 'll also	2

let me start by <unk> that my five stars are for lunch on mill . rula bula is a bit of a <unk> lunch place : if you 've gone at night when school 's in , it is very clearly a `` get <unk> '' frat boy crazy kind	4
pallets needs a bit of work . the decor is fun , but i could 've done without mma on the tv . that said , the service was fine , the tea was fine , and my pork fried rice was decent . the egg rolls were also decent	1
great place , delicious breakfast , relatively cheap . sad that they do n't use real maple syrup , but their cinnamon buns are amazing and their scrambles are top-notch .	3
welcome diner in its latest incarnation is a gem . their new hours make them far more accessible for dinner service , but you 'll still want to plan on showing up relatively late , at least during the summer , as most of their seating is outside . the	4
i first sampled chef beckett 's food at staff meal at petite maison . he had cooked up an amazing grilled cheese with pancetta and tomato bisque . happily , that 's on the menu at his own restaurant , which just opened this last week . the girlfriend and	4
it 's not casey 's . it 's just not . not even close . if you can get past that . i think the food is better . guinness pours are on par with casey 's , and they have live music . sometimes it 's even good !	3
i used to think the stereotypical italian grandmother who asks if you 're hungry and then feeds you regardless of your answer , and then feeds you again , and then makes you a sandwich , and then brings you a canolli , and then packs something for you to	3

hands down the best pizza , best ingredients in all of phoenix . this place is 100 % authentic and must be tried . puts humble pie to shame and give bianco a run for his money without a doubt . it is a new spot and the service means	4
it 's cold like always in theater .	3
the new pizza shop was closed , so plan b was dos gringos . the service was great . i had no compliments . i would go back again .	3
was looking for club dress and they had a great selection .	4

i came to fez for a birthday party , and was quite pleased really . the decor was very modern , and the restaurant had a good vibe to it . there was a party of about 20 of us , and they had no problem accommodating seating arrangements .	3
my best friend and i just experienced drift for the first time on saturday , and we had a great time ! we had the spinach artichoke dip , and it was to die for . absolutely delicious , and it was only $ 5 or somewhere in that neighborhood	3
i 've had a good first experience at the stand ! their food is all fresh , made to order . i love that . the menu is simple and to the point , with a few extra ingredients like caramelized onions and grilled jalapeo for flair on your burger	3
i stopped by chop shop one sunny afternoon , and after i finished ordering i inquired to the young girl behind the counter how things are going . she replied `` well , good . in fact , most people who came here on day one still come back almost	3

go during happy hour or you are not getting a deal the food is a-okay . but not a place i would ever `` crave '' basic greek and pita food nothing crazy . . what i do love about this place is the decor .	2
i love love love this place ! top reasons why i love this place : - the americana theme - best happy hour in the valley - service is outstanding : -rrb- i had a philly <unk> -lrb- : its not a fancy place but it is a place you	4
spicy noodles were delish . service was great food is out fast what more can you want ? perfect place for lunch with friends -lrb- :	3
a great place to enjoy the patio for lunch or a $ 5 glass of wine before 6pm ! obviously , the wines offered for $ 5 are not the best and highest priced ones from the regular menu , but it 's still a great deal . the small	3
consistently disappointing <unk> our experiences here . the chips and salsa -lrb- ask for hot salsa -rrb- and inferno sauce are the only positive factors at this restaurant . my husband and i have ordered food here numerous times and each time leave shaking our heads wondering why we did	1
a great late night spot when you 're looking to stay out of old town , but not a place that i would make it a point to dine at otherwise . for several years , `` the bat cave '' has been our late night stops after concerts ,	2
yep , good ol' simple home cooking , and by ` home cooking ' i mean back when no one cared that there was about three cups of butter in per serving . if you 've never gone , do n't be scared off by all the butter references ,	4
i 've been driving past this intriguing little place for years now , and finally stopped in to satisfy my curiosity . i had been warned by a friend that it was not worth going for lunch , as the food was n't very good , but i was craving	1
if you live in tempe , this has to be a staple to your menu . good , fat sandwiches on thick slices of toasted bread . always have new england chowder - and you get the bread bowl even if you get it to go , very nice .	3
impressed on so many levels with this <unk> gem in phoenix . i had heard of richardson 's , and for my friend 's going <unk> birthday dinner , he requested that we go to richardson 's `` other restaurant . '' like any good yelper i checked its profile	4
i was really impressed with this <unk> cafe . i think i committed three moving violations in two minutes trying to find a place to park and being trapped on the southbound side of central -lrb- stupid awesome light rail ! -rrb- . on an aside , anyone else not	3
the food is fantastic , the only reason i detract a star is for ambiance . it 's all down home , country themed -lrb- country as in floral curtains , not music -rrb- . and it 's popular with the over 50 crowd ... so , not my breakfast	3
this bar is nice and laid back , with thrift store decor and spacious patio and inside area . the bar staff is super cool and sans attitude at this scottsdale late night eating staple . i think they were voted `` cutest , girl next door waitresses '' in	3
i 'm really into this bar , but only every now and then . they get a lot of the same kinds of requests , and they usually play them on rotation each weekend , so i would n't recommend coming every week . the musicians are good and have	4

nothing can replace the original postino 's , but this central ave. location comes pretty close . perfect little lunch spot featuring your favorites -lrb- i.e. bruschetta planks in all the varieties , yummy paninis and plenty of wine -rrb- and my personal favorite part , the smokin ' $	4
the kids who work here are always good looking and nice , a rare and appreciated combination . i steer clear two months before and two months after christmas , the line is too much . i did happen to go mid december to pick up a new ipod since	3
i first started hitting up the alley at age 15 , when i was finally allowed to go to shows ... ha , it was the height of ska -lrb- i mean the height of ska before it hit uber mainstream and <unk> rocked <unk> big fish in their opening	3
this is sprawling , brand new `` campus '' located right in downtown mesa . performing arts stages , galleries , classes , restaurants ... this <unk> campus is a really , really nice venue to do anything . my architect friend said the campus was a little ... over	4
i was really impressed with this place . it reminded me a lot of plaid in tempe , but without the <unk> attitude from <unk> and dingy , <unk> atmosphere . the food was delish - i had vegan crab puffs -lrb- wow , these were good ! -rrb- and	4
after two years of going to postino 's and thinking every time , ' i have to try this place soon , ' i finally lost my <unk> -lrb- pronounced `` <unk> '' ; i did n't know either until i caught one of their chefs on a morning news	3
pretty good place to buy or sell used books , cds , movies , etc. i have n't really been since the <unk> of <unk> , but i always <unk> <unk> over this place for atmosphere , authenticity of `` record '' shop and staff .	2
food was alright . i got the clams with linguine in white sauce . i prefer whole clams with their shells in this pasta dish but the one here came with the canned clams . it was a little too greasy for my taste and it had too much parmesan	1
small breakfast menu ... probably a better place for lunch due to more choices . i got the san <unk> omelet -lrb- which the cashier said was their best seller -rrb- . it was nothing spectacular and needed more veggies . i also got the iced coffee and thought it	1
probably the first mexican restaurant i ate at upon moving to the east valley . i 'm a bit of a connoisseur now since i 've eaten at a hundred other joints since then . great carne asada . probably in the top ten . burros are fab and their	2
food is okay but not worth the lengthy wait on weekends . if there were more breakfast choices around this area , tbc would be empty . i 've ordered breakfast on two occasions here and both times it came out cold , plus the order was messed up .	1
happy hour <unk> <unk> 6 pm weekdays . there must have been 30 guys and maybe 5 chicks on two different occasions . whoa ! i like the specials and love the malibu accessories spread across the walls . way to get my attention !!	2
wow . my new favorite spot . the fried chicken is fab !! -lrb- our server called it comfort food , hahaha !! -rrb- so is the canolli . just make sure you tell them to ditch the mushrooms if that 's not your thing . they do n't tell	3
the amc does a great job of using multiple theatres for the blockbuster movies . although they are usually all quite full , i 've never run into the disappointment of not getting to see a movie because it 's only in one theatre . the staff is super friendly	3
i 've been frequenting this place for a <unk> time . it reminds me of the funky artsy <unk> in la , around the melrose district . their <unk> of furniture - midcentury <unk> line the walls and old <unk> tables - complement the easy , laidback vibe of the	3

in my quest to try all the restaurants on 7th street near my house , i decided to check out pizza heaven . pizza heaven is another one of those hole-in-the-wall eateries that you hear about via <unk> . oh sure , i can sit here and <unk> out <unk>	3
mmm , lux . some of the best coffee in phoenix . the interior is <unk> as new artists are featured on its walls and the furniture is <unk> on a regular basis . beans are fresh roasted on the premises so you know it 's fresh and not <unk>	3
qcumberz is the first business i 've gotten to review with both of those <unk> used letters z and q in its name -lrb- sorry , quiznos , maybe i 'll get to you eventually -rrb- . this place looks small , but it just keeps going and going ...	3
this little hole in the wall has delicious sandwiches ! they have a huge collection of old school sodas and you can turn any one into a float .	4
sandwiches are great but both times the service has n't been good ... kinda leaves a bad taste .	2
the huge screen and <unk> digital <unk> make this an awesome theater to see a blockbuster film in . all harkins theaters are great because their concession stand does n't rip you a new one when you show up -lrb- yay loyalty cups ! -rrb- , but this theater is	4
we 've been a few times and think it 's a fun place to bring people from out of town . i honestly felt that the steak quality was no better than outback , but at least they have ambiance and live music . awful parking though !! use the	2
i 've been to the big bang a few times , always on a fri or sat night . each time has been great . the dueling pianos are fun to hear and go back and forth . the players do an excellent job of getting the crowd going .	3
great place for breakfast or lunch . i really like the low carb menu . friendly staff . get there early as there can usually be a long line because of the great food .	3
i recently went to gb on a tuesday night with some friends for a drink or two around 8 pm . the place was not busy at all . there were only a few patrons here . the place was a ghost town . we sat down in the cocktail	1

after working down the street from freddy 's for a year and half and wanting to go , i finally went with a coworker who raved about the place . i ordered the # 1 combo , burger , drink and fries . the meal was just under $ 7	3
service here is always friendly , and it 's a pleasant place that offers a lot of fish for the buck . go for fish over lobster or shrimp , as you get more food for the buck , and it tastes good going down . plus , salsa bar	1
beautiful bountiful burger ! this mildly <unk> diner is the one inexpensive eatery in old town , so i walked in with low expectations but left delighted -lrb- and very full -rrb- . trying the texas burger appears to be almost mandatory among yelpers , and a very fine burger	3
the food always seems to get better with each trip . of course when i leave im stuffed and feel like im going to explode . that 's my own fault . . i like this location . we are always seated pretty quickly . if we have to wait	3

we biked down after work today to try out fuego 's newest restaurant , and if you know me at all though , you know my real motivation was the froyo next door . it was the `` let 's try out the new fuego '' that convinced my wife	3
i have never been into harkins camelview before , and was n't extremely delighted with the theater itself . seemed like a blast from the past , sort of old , dark and dreary . i like that they exclusively show <unk> <unk> films , so if you 're into	2
i have a hard time deciding what to write about angels trumpet , not being a fan of beer , it 's hard to give any of the breweries around town a fair shake . on their menu they 've got items like spam sliders , home made pop tarts	3
lets just set the record straight here . zoe 's serves mediterranean just like qdoba serves mexican . when i say just like the q , i mean the entire experience . walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel ; which is probably because	2
i was looking for a place to listen to some cool and funky live music and <unk> hit the spot . soul power seems to be a staple here , and they did n't dissapoint . the place is kind of a dive , reasonably priced libations , fun atmosphere	3
a solid choice for any froyo lover ; but i find it hard to visit with mojo only 2 blocks away . i just ca n't stay away from mojo with their b1g1 free yelp check in , which shows from my huge -lrb- # of check-ins there -rrb- .	3
had their tacos and a margarita . was dissapointed with the marg , the tacos were decent . prices seemed a bit steep for the tacos , they were small but the price was big . all in all , i would n't specifically avoid this place , but i	2

found myself in the area today and needed a few basic items so i stopped in . this place is certainly a marketplace ! i felt as if i was shopping in another country almost . it was kinda fun and a bit intimidating . but an experience worth taking	2

i came here on a saturday night to watch an asu game and have a nice dinner . it 's located right off scottsdale road , easily visible from the street . there was no wait when we came -lrb- around 8pm -rrb- but very packed . we were seated	3

love , love , love their buffalo grilled wings and buffalo chicken strips . the only other thing i 've had was the pizza and it was , eh , okay . they do have a great happy hour , if you like margaritas . service is good .	3
i 'm usually a big fan of dive bars but was n't impressed , at all . one of the kegs was empty so my friends did n't get their `` favorite '' beer , not a huge deal but not a good thing for 5pm on a friday .	1
i had a hankering for raw fish today and decided to give moto a try . overall i was pleased . the menu had a wide variety of tempting asian treats but i was here for fish , so i ordered the sashimi combo with a bowl of miso .	2

unfortunately it was a while since i ate here but forgot to write this review sooner . overall i was pretty pleased with their food here . their agedashi tofu was done in a way that was so different from the typical . the sauce was actually a mushroom broth	3
very nice library . cool staff , good selection , easy to order items they do not have there . chill place to kick back as well . just wish they did n't have that $ 1 fee if you forgot to pick up an item on hold ... .	3
most people over the age of 21 have had some sort of <unk> experience . by themselves , with someone else ... whatever . the reason i mention this is that the food here has been so good in my experience , my taste buds have exploded with <unk> .	4
great place with a cool college vibe . the rolls are unique to the community and the service is awesome ! $ 1.50 beers during happy hour !	3
maybe it 's because this location is on mill avenue , but i 've had better . the sushi is average , the prices are higher than normal , and the service is poor . we called ahead to schedule a larger group and the hostess told us she ``	1
what an amazing place ! from the moment you pull up , the vibe at jobot is unlike any other coffee shop i 've been to in phoenix -lrb- or ever , for that matter ! -rrb- . located in the heart of roosevelt row , this lovely place fits	3
another one of joe 's <unk> . i eat here whenever in the area . casual atmosphere . great food ; their rice pudding is excellent ; great hamburgers and sloppy joes . alway a good place to go for great food at a reasonable price . you have to	4
great place to visit and check out the olive oil products available in addition to their food and desserts . stop by relax and enjoy the activity . you will not be disappointed . a jewel in the <unk> valley .	3
great place to have good a meal ; the set up of aunt chilada 's works well for private parties ; good outdoor seating as well . i think you will enjoy the experience .	3
i like grazie , it 's a great little pizza and wine spot to have a nice dinner date . we ordered a pitcher of sangria and shared a <unk> alla mamma pizza which was thin crusted and flavorful . i am a big fan of ricotta cheese and the	3

piestewa peak has definitely become one of my favorite hikes here in arizona . with my beloved camelback put on the side <unk> while under construction , we have substituted piestewa to fill in the <unk> . this hike , in my opinion , is the hike most similar to	4
this is my favorite breakfast spot in arizona hands down ! every time i have visitors from out of town i suggest this for breakfast . even when they were at the smaller location i would bring my friends from ca there when i used to live in downtown .	4
had dinner here with my bf 's family and i really enjoyed the food ! first , we had the pretzel appetizer that the waiter recommended and it was fairly addicting . it was so fresh we had to wait a while for it to cool down . it came	4
this is another bar we like to hit when we do n't want to get all dressed up and instead have a `` shorts and flip flops '' kind of night . the specials are awesome and they have some fun games like giant connect four . me and the	3
the stand holds a special spot in my heart before i even tried their food since this is the old location of maui dogs , and that 's where i had my first date with the <unk> . that 's what made it even more satisfying to find that the	3
i love coming to crescent mostly because i get to hang out with loved ones when i 'm here . my bf 's hipster brother lives <unk> and we do n't get to see him often , so i 've always had a good time catching up with him here	4
we 've since gone back a few times , and i have to say they have one of the best burgers in phoenix . and the cheese fries are great , too !	4
this place serves the best hot and sour soup ever !! the atmosphere was clean and modern , the food was fresh and so flavorful , and the service was quick and polite . this is officially my favorite chinese food restaurant now . it 's located in a strip	4
let me start by saying this place is really hard to find ! even with my trusty gps i found myself walking in circles and calling , calling , calling . i 've seen many complaints about service on here , and while my service was not bad in terms	3
ok , so i think i 'm going to say i like this place even more than i did before . all because it is clear you have to be adventurous and try different things on the menu before you really make a judgment . on my second visit ,	3
when i sat down at the table with my boyfriend , who happens to really like this place , i really felt like i 'd found another cool gem in phoenix . a somewhat <unk> decorated little `` cave '' this is , i settled in on good conversation before	2

the caramel macaroons here are to die for ! that being said , this is a very cute restaurant , though the venue is a tad small ! be prepared to wait for a table if you get there at lunch time but the food is worth it . it	3
burrito excellent ... linguini not so good ... but i liked the walnut `` meatballs '' . for <unk> i 'm far from a vegetarian , i prefer a juicy burger .	1
no this is not a gourmet burger shop ... it 's just a down and dirty , greasy , meat and bun burger , <unk> your arteries type of burger ... . . but it is good and cheap !	3
wow ... the food was very good and it seemed very authentic since there were what appeared to be cambodian clients ... yes <unk> <unk> is part of my search of authentic dishes . the signature fish dish was excellent and the service was very good . i also tried	4
reminds me alot of cucina tagliani -lrb- a small chain of italian restaurants in the west valley -rrb- . went here for a friend 's birthday . the <unk> : if you go home hungry , its your fault . they 'll do their best to fill you up on	3
came here for restaurant week as the reviews for this place seemed pretty stellar . first things first , outstanding service -lrb- almost <unk> so -rrb- . our server gary took great pains to ensure the four of us had a good experience and were taken care of . props	3
a longtime valley institution , i 've been going to mary coyle 's ice cream for over a decade and its exactly the same then as is it is today . located on 7th ave. in north central phoenix , this small ice cream spot brings in people from all	3
i feel like this place gets an unfair wrap in part because its constantly compared with matt 's big breakfast . yes , matt 's is better . but no the gap is n't that wide . i took a group of 4 of us to breakfast here this morning	3
really awesome little neighborhood candy and dessert shop . variety of treats available including rice krispy treats , ice creams , pies , and hard candies . i got the s'mores sundae . holy moly was it good -lrb- and huge -rrb- . it was about $ 6 but worth	3
food was okay . did n't really care for the texture of the meatballs and the bread was rock hard . that said the appetizers and desserts were good . supposedly the pancakes are where its at so i may try those next time . a little bit pricey for	2
i was lucky enough to get tickets for the john <unk> <unk> concert here not long ago . it was my first visit to symphony hall since it <unk> an extensive multi million dollar renovation years ago . it was also my first time seeing the phoenix symphony in action	4
another ddd try , we had to come here twice . the first time it was just to crowded . glad we came back . i really enjoyed the daily special , which changes every day . also enjoyed the waffles . wife and daughter enjoyed the usual eggs and	3

i have had the opportunity to watch games at the staples center , and honda center in los angeles and anaheim . both are great arenas and are very fan friendly . jobing.com is totally different , and that 's not a bad thing ! i really enjoy the arena	3
not going to try and act like a food critic here ! if you are looking to try this place , then you already know about seasons 52 . wife , daughter , and myself came here on a saturday for our wedding anniversary ! i had their chili ,	3
this place is amazing ! since i was kicked out of my house ! -lrb- my 20 yr old daughter wanted to have a romantic dinner with her boyfriend ! -rrb- i took the wife out ! i have heard about ipic , but never looked into it ! so	3
on a whim i showed up last saturday night without reservations and waited 45 minutes for a table outside on the patio . well worth the wait to enjoy al fresco dining on a beautiful patio . i thought the menu items overall were a tad pricey . so i	2
i dined at the arrogant butcher last night while a suns game was in progress . the place was packed on a saturday night and you could definitely feel the <unk> and energy throughout the restaurant . i was with a group of about 10 people and we had a	2
i 'm taking my rating down from 5 to 3 stars because k o'donnell 's food has been inconsistent the last couple of times i have been there . i was really disappointed with the <unk> pizza this past weekend . it looked to me that the cook forgot to	2
i love the olive garden . although it cost $ <unk> -lrb- before tip -rrb- for a party of three on my recent visit on <unk> . if you really believe those awesome breadsticks are free , think again . i recommend the <unk> chicken con broccoli and the minestrone	4
anybody that does n't give this place 5 stars has to have their head <unk> . we brought some out of town visitors to the <unk> railroad park the other night and had a blast . i think we spent $ 14 for the whole evening for 4 adults and	4
costco has something for everybody . i try to go here in the evenings after 7pm since this place is a zoo during the day . i had to break that rule when i decided that i was mad as hell and i was n't going to go to my	3
i enjoyed my maiden voyage to first watch this past sunday . my wife and i were here early before 9am so there were n't the crowds that i have read about in past reviews . i had `` the traditional '' which consists of two eggs scrambled with 4	3
awesome breakfast place as well . yesterday i had the western omlette which comes with country potatoes and an english muffin for $ 6.50 . there was so much delicious filling food that i skipped lunch yesterday . kudos habanero 's !	4
i have been to jason 's deli several times . i want to rave about their bowl of red beans & rice spiked with chunks of sausage for $ <unk> that fills me up . and do n't forget the free all you can eat garlic bread slices . this	3
my wife and i enjoyed the 12 inch sausage and grilled vegetable pizza -lrb- grilled vegetables is definitely out of my comfort zone -rrb- . the pizza tasted great , we spent $ 18 on this medium pizza , a little bit pricy in my opinion . they do have	3
went there for lunch today and spent $ <unk> for the buffet and a soda . the salad with the fresh vegetables was good and the clam chowder soup was ok . the pasta was n't the greatest and i did n't care too much for the bread or pizza	1
if you ca n't cook and need a good home cooked meal then head over to beaver 's choice . the average tab per person for dinner is about $ 15 . the 20-30 minute wait for the food was not a big deal . it gives you a chance	3
okay , movies are only $ 3 ... $ 2 on tuesday . popcorn and soda are reasonably priced . seats are pretty comfortable . wish they would a -rrb- put in <unk> in their lobby to <unk> the lines up and b -rrb- do the same for the snack	2
from may 20 , 2010 -- or those of you who love the mediocre food and service of caffe boa ahwatukee -lrb- no relation -rrb- , do n't go to the tempe big sister . tempe 's caffe boa , headed by chef payton curry , is sleek , friendly	2
picazzo 's has undergone a name change and new menu , but <unk> things are the same ... they 're just touting their organic and local qualities . their `` puttanesca '' pizza -lrb- artichokes , olives , feta , tomato -rrb- is outstanding , though has nothing to do	3
wonderful place . the interior is charming and the <unk> she is was friendly and inviting . seared kale , green beans , beets & sweet potato salad with basil goat cheese is out of this world . for vegans the goat cheese can be switched out for hummus .	4
my sister passed along a free movie pass so the hubby and i went yesterday . this place is really nice ! i 'm not much of a drinker , but the bar was impressive . we were the first of 6 people to arrive for the afternoon showing of	3

i do n't know if this restaurant is mexican , puerto rican or cuban , but i do n't get it . we split the monster quesadilla which has jack cheese , monterey cheese some tomato and jalapeno peppers . i went with the sweet corn tamale as my entree	1
the prices are unbeatable . the menu is extensive . my husband loves beef so this was the perfect place for him . unfortunately , this restaurant is not vegetarian or <unk> friendly so i will not be returning for myself , but i will pick up take out for	2
good , but the salad was not as good as remembered . still think its a great spot in <unk> !	2
we never go to breakfast , but glad we did . happen to be in the area and great place . good portions , good value . had the breakfast chorizo and was really really good . if it was a bit closer to home would definitely go back .	3
this is our spot ! sit at the bar , get good company , good drinks and a great happy hour .	4
food , really great . service , good . atmosphere ... great looking place , but not a really fun atmosphere . been here twice , friday happy hour and a wednesday dinner . friday at the bar was mildly busy , good bartenders . wednesday was dead , but	2
the food is very yummy . the coffee to die for . the place moves at its own pace ... which for some in this `` i want it now '' world may be slow . so go there with someone you want to talk to , take your time	3
we went for dinner . the staff is excellent . very attentive , prompt and super ! we split their burger and fries . delicious ! also , love the decor and ambience . but if you sit outside avoid sitting at a table where the waiting benches back up	3
two additional visits : one for happy hour . go the cheese appetizer plate ... bit pricey $ 18 for a <unk> plate . north has a better plate for $ 10 happy hour . also , the waitresses blood went cold the second she realized we were there for	3
been there twice . once for a yummy brunch . for $ 10 <unk> you get a choice of delicious meal and a beer or mimosa . service was very friendly and timely . i got the eggs on muffins with bacon and salsa ... very tasty . also went	3

i bought a pair of <unk> from here once . i love those <unk> by <unk> <unk> . also the crafty burritos hang out here on the third saturday of each month and they have some amazing handmade items for sale .	2
excellent ! sometimes a little noisy . sometimes a wait . i pretty much always get a lettuce wrap cheeseburger , their bread is too big and sweet potato fries ! i love how the fries come out in little shopping carts . it was the first restaurant i had	3
disgusting . i would never eat here again . gary and i went to mill on sunday . we wanted to go to the bookstore and to try someplace new . when we walked in , he said , let 's go , i do n't want to eat here	0
outrageously large portions , good enough to share with the whole family . the baked beans are also fantastic as a side as well as the slaw . i 'm not a huge fan of the bbq sauces , but the meat is just right : -rrb-	2
delicious popsicles ! yumm ! while i 'm not used to paying so much for a fruit bar -lrb- since they come pretty cheap at the grocery store -rrb- the flavors here are amazing and fresh ! i was introduced to this shop by a friend who recently began working	3
marble rum cake is to die for . so is the tiramisu cake . recently they started selling macarons as well , for under $ 1 each , which makes a nice snack when you 're craving some french cookies : -rrb-	4
i went for happy hour and was pleased with the food and service . i agree with some of the past reviews that the food is nothing special . the guac was good , but i prefer the guac at the mission . there is something special about it made	3
the experience started out a little slow but quickly turned into a great time . we had the mushroom taco , pork taco and fish taco . the mushroom taco should only be ordered if you are vegetarian . the pork taco was outstanding . i do n't typically order	4

we had a nice evening here . it feels like a `` cozy date '' restaurant and all was delish . came via a yelp search and was pleased at the results . first of all the margaritas are really really good . they make their own sweet and sour	3
we always go non chain and love this local joint . the fish tacos , shrimp quesadillas and burros are our favorites . lulu 's caters also . it <unk> ' t cheap but it is really good .	3
we really like this venue . it is small so there is no bad seat in the house . we had a general admission for a concert and are so glad we did n't get seats . they were crammed together in front . the lawn is <unk> to you	3
we came here based on good yelp reviews . delicious fresh and great . i am not a big breakfast fan so for me to be psyched is unusual . the restaurant is darling with exposed brick and <unk> <unk> . they moved down a block last year to accommodate	3

the restaurant is very nice on the inside compared to the outside . i nice place for a date . i ordered the tom <unk> gai and it was very flavorful , not quite as rich with coconut milk as at thai rama , but still very good . i	3
i would probably give it a 4.5 . the sticky buns are all they 're cracked up to be !! delicious . i ordered the filet and it was delicious and like butter . i ordered it medium rare , i know it 's not how ladies usually order it	3
i do n't think i can live without thai rama ! as i said in my earlier review , the # 18 soup is amazingly delicious ! the # 23 garlic chicken is probably my favorite dish ! i 've been ordering a different curry every time i go .	4
oh biancos . this is n't really a restaurant you can just say `` hey , lets go get a quick bite to eat '' . this is a commitment of time . there are other pizza places in phoenix , with perfectly good food . biancos though , it	3
the food was impressive . the fox concept restaurants never seem to disappointment and north proved that again . for starters we had the zucchini chips , which were the most addictive things i 've had in a long time . i really wish i had a continuous filling bowl	3
the atmosphere is moody and dark , which i 'm a huge fan of . there were comfy couches , and beautiful chandeliers hanging from the ceiling . the appetizers were fantastic . i had the tuna tartar , chicken wings , and the scallops . towards 11pm the bar	3
i really wish i lived in downtown phx so i could make maizie 's a regular brunch spot . the $ 15 mimosa buckets are way too tempting ... actually , it 's probably better i do n't live near by . we went on a saturday morning while on	3
beautiful people , tasty brushetta , good wine all go well with the good weather . no complaints , but this place could you an early acoustic jazz happy hour a little more regularly . great place in the sun !	4
love this place . the food is good too , but this dining is all about this setting . deep in the walnut orchard under shady trees . sitting across from the one in your life . it is 4 stars just because the service is getting a little weak	3
finally a raw food cafe that is n't in tempe . love their drinks and raw food menu . just wish their prices would come down bit . this is the type of place i could eat at everyday . i know it is good because the afternoon lull does	4
my couple friends from india spoke badly of this place . however , upon reflection , i ca n't think of a time where any indian friends , have ever given a favorable review of any indian restaurants . i ate here and loved it . i got the dosa	4

i love the food , but its just pizza they are over charging and trying to make the place way too swanky . i have been to italy every <unk> chef can make delicious pizzas like these there . they difference is they do n't <unk> you or pretend its	3

after reading all the reviews i had to check it out . unfortunately , i think i 'm going to have to go again . not that it 's bad that i 'm going again mind you , it 's just that i did n't really get to see it	3
i love every sandwich i 've had here - except the philly . how weird is that ? it 's my friend 's favorite sandwich , but to me it 's just missing a little something . on the other hand , the pork is amazing . add the <unk>	3

i 'm in love ! i came here after purchasing a groupon ... we sat on the patio enjoying the great weather . our server was great and we quickly found out he was the owner/chef . they were offering two liquors that evening and one was a vodka filtered	4

i stopped in for a few drinks and some food with a few friends . we sat in the bar . the female bartender was really unfriendly in the beginning but eventually warmed up . they have fresh squeezed juices and i love that !! i had a delicious greyhound	3
found this hidden place by accident . you order at the counter and they bring your food to the table . we started with shrimp and pork spring rolls . they were good and a large portion . when it comes to pho the choices are limited to basic chicken	2

as promised , here 's my `` make-up visit '' update . things improved dramatically since the last time i went . firstly , our server was n't an upsell machine . in fact , she was very polite and concerned about our order -lrb- mine was particularly attentive with	3

this is a nice way to spend a day off . especially if , like me , you 're from a place that does n't have desert plant life and want to learn more about the mystical desert gyms like cacti , agave , et cetera . lots of scenery	3

went here for lunch to get a cheesesteak and it was fantastic . lightly buttered , toasted , soft bun , and plenty of meat , onions , mushrooms , and green peppers on top . if you do n't want cheese wiz then you can get it with provolone	3

minus one star for being the type of place where you 're always asking yourself `` ass or <unk> ? '' apparently , it can get way too crowded for its own good so you 'll be doing some serious rubbing as you navigate through the sea of yup .	3
it 's simple . i really wanted - scratch that - needed a pastrami sandwich on christmas . and thanks to some wonderful cultural differences , chompie 's was open . the rest is history .	3

this little place will surprise you . the burgers are awesome and the prices are reasonable . why ca n't we have more of this and less <unk> ?	3
never had a bad dish at babbo . the prices are fair and the staff is nice . it can get very busy at peak times . it is best to go on off nights or off hours to avoid the crowd .	3
the sub sandwich of burgers . seriously . i could only eat half and i can put it away . the patty is just so thick , i could n't handle it . i must really need to get laid if that last sentence about a thick hamburger sounded <unk>	3

a recent lunch at nee house changed my whole opinion of this restaurant . the crab and dried scallop fried rice was as good as the best fried rice i 've eaten while living in hong kong . the rice <unk> were perfectly al dente , not greasy , well-seasoned	3
our new local favorite ! they took our business from zoyo ... . we live in the neighborhood ... support !!!!	4

awesome food and drinks . i have been here many times and i am always pleased . my favorite is the chopped salad .	3
very few healthy and vegetarian options . i ended up with the humus and vegetables , which were alright . the mojito was a super drink choice . the beer flight was a great way to try many different beers .	2
this place wants to be postino , but has worse wine and the food is subpar . we went on a saturday and out was so loud we could not have a conversation because our was too loud . we will not be going back , try postino if you	1
this is my `` go-to '' place for groceries when i actually want to cook something . chain supermarkets have such a limited variety of produce and ingredients . if you 're tired of paying for overpriced , <unk> , wax covered fruit , then leelee 's is the place	4
what the pho , man ?! the food is bland . it tastes like they cater to the elderly . the prices are high for the type of food you are getting . nobody should have to bay over $ 5.75 for any type of pho . i 've gone	0
my kids thoroughly enjoyed having dessert here . i am not too big on desserts , but the paletas they serve there tastes as natural as can be . . it 's a pretty healthy alternative to to other desserts . paletas betty has a great selection of flavors .	3
the staff here is always friendly . they 're always on the ball with the drink refills . you 'll get good food for inexpensive prices here . i 've eaten here and ordered off of the lunch menu and dinner menu . i really have n't had a bad	3

i am in love ... this place rocks ... i have been there twice in the last three days , and so far tried the mojo classic chocolate and the pomegranate and both were delicious ... so delicious that both times i got brain freeze from indulging them so fast	3
top notch . i went here with a friend , after a nice early evening of window shopping around the biltmore , looking at things that i would either never buy because they are hideous or just way over priced , but i must say the biltmore is so choice	4
i love you man !!! is the movie i went to see last night at this theater . so i go to this place because it is close to my house is really never that crowded , there are two reasons why this place does not get a <unk> rating	2

i loved the baked ziti but the meatball was terrible . dry old . burned . no flavor . what <unk> me is why the menu says its one of their special items . clearly they do n't make them fresh	1

the thing i love about this place is that its simple . sandwiches , salads , soups . breakfast and lunch . there menu is specific ... what comes on the meal and what health benefits -lrb- if any -rrb- . they do not serve soda . tea , lemonade	4
maybe i 've never owned a pickup truck or slept with my sister but i do n't get this place just the same . i might as well see stellar reviews for burger king or wendys . this place is fast food , processed , greasy , nothing special .	1
i have waited up to 15 minutes in the drive thru here for an iced coffee ... i gave this place 5 stars i have been late to work , threatening my career with a company i 've spent almost a decade with ... i gave this place 5 stars	4
this pizza is the only official <unk> napoletana pizza in arizona . although this could be a <unk> award it does n't mean it 's not delicious . this pizza is amazing , the ingredients are quality and the flavor of the sauce is what really puts it over the	3

over easy has gotten too big for its <unk> ... they 've jumped the shark ! just visited the new location and came to the conclusion that this place thinks its too good for their own customers . the food is slightly above average , do n't get me wrong	2
sure the food is good , but out of my last 20 take out orders they got it right maybe once . the people making the food look so high you would think you were at cheba hut , but i just love that damn broccoli and wisconsin cheese soup	3
this was my <unk> first visit to p.f. chang 's and it was very satisfying . went for lunch on a friday and it was not very busy at all . i 'll get into the food in a bit , but first i have to applaud chang 's for	3

i stop here everyday , when i can . the `` matador '' is the best coffee drink on the planet , it makes my coworker go in to this <unk> frenzy . like a mexican <unk> . the chocolate croissant is the best thing i have ever put in	4
$ 8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg , two greasy strips of bacon , and a stale muffin . they say it 's pricy because they get it local ? it has to have substance to be considered anything . so whack .	0
went here for the first time yesterday and it was great ! i love fried chicken and theirs is really great especially if you add on the louisiana hot sauce ... ummm ! shared a <unk> 's which consisted of 3 pieces of fried chicken , 2 waffles , grits	3

had a great time here last week with my daughters . it 's good to go soon after they get set-up -lrb- less stinky -rrb- . the rides were fun , the food awesome , and the games were the same old trickery - though now you pay for them	3
the interior is impressive and this might be great place to watch a game and grab a brew . however , the food quality is less than impressive . i will not come here again to dine . it is a waste of money for the bland <unk> generic style	2
in the evening the view from south mountain 's lookout is an amazing , surreal scene -- much better than that big ol' hole up north ... an endless , dreamy sea of lights that completely surrounds you ... i have been taking visitors here for almost <unk> , and	4
the fish market has been here awhile , and it is still going strong . for the price this is one of the finest seafood restaurants in the city . i adore their clam chowder -lrb- white -rrb- , and just about everything else on the menu . that have	4

i liked their original little place on the other side of the shopping plaza just fine , but this is even better . great decor , amazing food and very reasonable pricing . put this one on your list .	3
this restaurant helped <unk> scottsdale 's reputation as a foodie city and cowboy ciao is still one of the most consistently excellent places that i 've had the pleasure of dining . the menu is sparse , and for good reason , every single dish is done to perfection .	4
decent dive bar for mesa -lrb- <unk> border off the 101 -rrb- . this is another place that depends on the quality of the band . the music is why most people are here , and you wo n't have much luck chatting after 8pm as the place gets loud	2
fantastic change of pace . i loved their swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes and their pork schnitzel is also amazing . all dinners come with a multitude of delicious sides . unfortunately , the atmosphere here is about as romantic as a <unk> -- luckily they are moving to a	3
i really enjoyed my first visit here . the burgers are <unk> ala burger king . no , this is not a gourmet burger , but a basic one done right . the decor is modern and trendy with big comfy booths . service is a little slow , but	3
great local dive bar which has been around for over 25 years now ... this place is really big with a massive , covered , <unk> outdoor smoking area . shuffleboard , pool , ping pong , and darts ... this place gets really busy , and much younger on	3
why is it that little run down places always serve the most amazing mexican food ? some obscure <unk> effect is at play i 'm sure ... anyway the chicken enchiladas were <unk> with perfectly cooked white chicken meat and served with a bold red sauce rather than the standard	3
this looks like a classy place to have dinner and a few cocktails with friends ... we headed here for drinks after dining at blanco . the place was less busy than i remember , making us <unk> a prime outdoor seating location possible ... the seven of us enjoyed	2
the shrimp tostada bites and the ny strip make this place a local favorite . they have a really happening happy hour too and are close to mega shopping opportunities .	3
grapevine has the best karaoke system in arizona and it runs every night after 5pm . they have another cute bar upstairs that 's covered but open-air and allows for smoking and conversation . they also have a huge upstairs patio for dining which tends to be very popular during	4
watching the suns <unk> and cleveland <unk> was a little sad . looked more like a sloppy college game to me . anyway , we enjoyed the nachos and the crowd . highlight of the night was getting caught in the rain waiting on a passing train to let us	2
first visit and while it was pretty slow on a sunday night , the place had a great vibe and potential . they only serve beer and wine but i think their decor and the film angle will serve them well . good luck filmbar !	3
again , for a chain this is an outstanding destination . i have never been let down here . always amazing food and excellent service , which is astonishing being that i live next door and have been here frequently . i have always loved houston 's best for lunch	3
locally owned for around twenty years this is a true neighborhood fixture . while it 's not going to win any <unk> awards the people and the food here are off the charts . i 'm talking about some really really good homemade food ! i loved this place from	4

simply the best bar in all of scottsdale . sure , there are swanky nightclubs , hotel resorts , dives , and lounges - but this is a good ol' neighborhood pub with cheap drinks and live music every night . <unk> might be the most unpretentious bar in old	4

an old school neighborhood sports bar with a huge <unk> patio . this is a very low key place to get some pub grub and a buzz while watching your favorite team . not being much of a sports fan , i still like it for it 's laid back	3
wow ! this is one of the best chinese food places in all of scottsdale . i have always loved flo 's -lrb- on frank lloyd wright -rrb- , but this might have <unk> it . the `` house special salad '' is freaking incredible , the shrimp spring rolls	4
overall decent place . i think networks greatest <unk> may be it 's location and the hours -lrb- open more then most hangouts downtown -rrb- . i have had several productive lunch meetings here and the food is decent . the nightlife is usually a little slow , and service	2
this place is old school to the point that the school needs to be <unk> ... i think the crowd here on certain nights might be great , but the place itself is just too rundown . we visited on a sunday night and were disappointed after all the positive	2
so this location has a chill patio surrounded by two indoor dining areas and a bar . very nice indeed . unfortunately they only have a few mixed drinks , beers , and wines - no full bar . oh , btw the food here is very very good !	3
finally made it up here on sunday -lrb- with a hangover -rrb- . we rolled in right when they open at 11am . got the <unk> cheeseburger with hatch chillies - it changed my life . the setting is really interesting too , you eat outside kind of like an	3

it 's `` ok '' . i love spicy food , and like someone else said , some of their dishes seem spicy just to be spicy <unk> full flavor . their margaritas are too sweet , imo , but do pack a punch . i also think their food	2
the heard museum is truly awesome . it 's not huge , but they make the most of their space , including short films , longer presentations , and a huge display of <unk> in telling the cultural stories of southwestern native americans . importantly realizing that native american cultures	4
why did it take me so long to find this place ? it 's kind of tucked away on the side of a shopping mall with very little fanfare . if you peek in you may think its just a bar , and indeed , they have a great selection	3
a group of 18 , and as the lunch group staggered in <unk> , the 2 waitresses could not be nicer or accommodating -lrb- even up to splitting checks , wow -rrb- . i took the <unk> , most everyone really enjoyed the offerings from the $ 11.50 4 course	3

i went here for dinner on friday night . it was about 8 and the place was pretty dead which was odd yet nice . i guess this place does a fair amount of pickup orders so that is probably why the place had only 3 or 4 more people	3

my fiance and i tried out this place the other night by placing a to-go order . we both liked the food and were impressed with the spiciness of the dishes . the meat was lean and the wide noodles were amazing , but i thought the veggies lacked freshness	2
i freakin love this place . the food is so darn delicious . i only have a couple complaints about the place , but the pros far out weigh the cons . the hallway like establishment is a little too cramped for my style , so i usually call in	3

great location . usually amazing shows . however i do n't usually come down here unless there is someone or a band specifically i enjoy playing here . great local bands are always here though and the art is always enjoyable .	3

everything about this restaurant is on point . from food selection to seating and atmosphere . i go here frequently and service is outstanding .	4
i have never had an unpleasant experience here . ive sat in multiple areas of the restaurant ... the upstairs being my favorite . i love the dim lighting and contrast in <unk> architecture . incredible seasonal food . wonderful service . i once stayed pass closing time without realizing	4

probably one of the best malls in the phoenix area . fairly new -lrb- 2001 maybe ? -rrb- and clean . good selection of shops with a large selection of restaurants surrounding the mall . theater is nice as well .	3
if you prefer locally-owned over starbucks , then come here . but do n't expect a whole lot of seating in this small coffee shop .	2
pretty fun place to go to . when it is busy there seems to be 1-2 beer pong tables going ... and maybe a game of flip cup . it is normally a open table for anyone who wants to play -lrb- or maybe i am just pushy that way	2
i like coming here in the morning and having a breakfast burrito and then going outside and sitting in the morning sun . it is nice too , if you happen to prefer a coffee or tea instead of a juice with your breakfast burrito then you can go next	3
