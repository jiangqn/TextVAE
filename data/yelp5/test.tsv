i 'm torn . this place is so darn charming , a very warm atmosphere , much cozier than its previous identity . the service during my -- brief -- visit was amazing : i was waited on immediately upon entering the door , but i wanted to order something	2
i have eaten lunch here -lrb- sandwich , chips , obligatory pickle -rrb- , but i am specifically yelping about the bakery . i purchased a `` holly <unk> '' cake for my mother to celebrate mother 's day , and was really disappointed . the price is steep -lrb-	1

i love this place ! love , love , love ...	4
i have not returned yet -lrb- although i expect to soon as i have a planned event at press next week -rrb- , but i think it is fair to share that the owner contacted me regarding my review . he was , of course , in his words ,	1

i know i may be <unk> by my fellow yelpers but ... i have not been impressed by breakfast here . i 've been here three times now , and the breakfast has been sub-par each time . in all honesty , i have not been here for lunch or	3
just go here , now . i really mean it ... go . real scandinavian folk , homemade and insanely good food . be prepared to wait a bit for your food . each dish is made to order so enjoy some good conversation in the mean time .	3
above average pho . the chicken they use is kind of <unk> and nasty in my opinion . establishment is super nice and clean . awesome atmosphere without a doubt . big bonus : lots of hot vietnamese women working in the kitchen .	3
good selection of sandwiches for a great price . the bread was very fresh and scrumptious . they also have the best <unk> ! the place was huge and clean . i will be going back for more for sure .	3

marcellino and <unk> are finally back after their yearly 1 month italy vacation -lrb- re-opened september 10th -rrb- ... and are we glad they are back ! we had a fabulous duo appetizer : fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet -lrb- carpaccio -rrb- with shaved mushroom	4
what a pleasant surprise this was . we had ventured to this part of tempe to finally visit the crepe bar , but sadly it was closed for the holidays - so this was the closest joint with solid reviews & we went for it . instantly wary when you	4
so , i 've been to whole foods before - and it 's always a visual treat . great selection , fresh , natural foods , lots of beautiful & healthy soccer moms <unk> about - but last night was the 1st time i visited their watering hole . immediately	1
sadly , i think this place is suffering from `` i do n't know what i want to be '' <unk> . in the past , we 've gone for the happy / reverse happy hour and had great experiences . but , saturday , unfortunately , it was just	1
do n't let the <unk> exterior -lrb- with the exception of the amazing mural -rrb- fool you at this joint ... it 's much bigger than it looks from the outside . the only food i tried was their margherita pizza , which was fresh and tasty - but far	3
ok , i 've been to this place probably ten times . and most of the choices we 're so-so ... but recently , i was introduced to their orange <unk> . it has two levels of deliciousness , and every time i try one it blows my mind .	4
so the place has christmas lights , and a fair amount of ambiance , and supposedly there 's a <unk> shot at 1:00 - which might make going back worth it . other than that , the service was less than lackluster , the domestic kegs all seemed flat .	1
had a lunch date here ... i had the grilled swordfish tacos and i forgot what he had ... i think the grilled ahi tuna . portions were on the smaller size for the price -lrb- yes even for lunch -rrb- . i kind of felt bad , because i	2

went to cg again tonight and definitely redeemed itself . had the lobster bisque soup for <unk> and shared the sliced filet mignon with <unk> onions and wild mushrooms with my girlfriend and was definitely very happy with this selection . the fresh warm hot rolls were exceptional as well	3
most people know houston 's . its a good standby . the service is always great and i love how the servers work as a team . houston 's has fantastic burgers if you did n't know . tip : they serve a strawberry shortcake for dessert in the summer	3

windsor is like postino and vig had a baby ! of course we had to start with the corn dog bites . i love these little nuggets of state fair gold . there were a few pieces of friend pickle chips in the basket -lrb- on purpose -rrb- ... nice	4
i love this sexy , modern chic restaurant with the equally inviting menu . everything from the <unk> walls , cool-looking servers and the interesting play on classic american food is wonderful ! the happy hour mon-fri from <unk> is great ! unlike some happy hour menus where they serve	3
the happy hour was better than i expected ! love this place .	3
been there for lunch a couple of times . the first time i was not impressed , and rather neutral about the experience . but i thought it was because i was on the phone w / biz the entire time . went last week w / a few folks	0
the lamb kisra -lrb- basically a pizza or flatbread -rrb- is soooooooo damn good ! the salad selection will make even the most focused foodie indecisive . not because there are too many selections , but b/c they 're all so interestingly delish ! the atmoshpere is super cool and	3
i love pita jungle 's food -lrb- service is another story -rrb- !! never had a bad meal . and what i love most of all is the lemon dressing they use on the greek salad . it 's soooo light and refreshing . the only thing i do n't	3
`` surprisingly good '' as one reviewer wrote ! so true ! odd looking place when you first walk in . menu is odd too and looks like a newspaper . but odd in a good way . all i can say is ... the rellenos are so so sinful	3
as usual , the collard greens were hit or miss . and this time was another `` miss '' . <unk> too peppery ! also as usual , the side dishes for one of the guests in my party did n't come out until after three requests for them ...	1

this is disneyland for bakers ! they have everything you will ever need to bake and more . for a newbie baker , like me , it can be intimidating . okay , it will be intimidating . however , i can keep walking through their aisles for hours and	3
melt in the mouth stuff . when a cupcake is that good , i barely notice the price . i know people complain about their price , but , i would rather pay the price than pile on calories eating a <unk> <unk> expensive treat . never been to their	3
what 's all the hype about ? yes , the fried chicken was good , but , the good ends there ! the service was slow and they not only messed up our order but also came back twice with food we never ordered to confirm that we , in	2
the brown butter sauce and pesto ranch are both worth trying at least once .	2
i love el encanto . we recently took my grandma and my kid for lunch . if you have n't been you should check it out . there is a really cool outside patio area around a large <unk> pond which really is the <unk> feature of the place .	4
cool place ! we stopped in to check out a very talented friend 's artwork on the walls at cartel for the month . the coffee drinks are great as are the beers .	3
i stopped in for dinner last night based on the menu i found on the web . i was very attracted to the healthy options listed . unfortunately , i passed over the salads and ordered the number two pizza . it was n't bad . it also was n't	1
az 88 is a staple when i visit scottsdale , always a treat ! the restaurant is off the beaten path and has an ultra hip vibe to it . the wait staff is friendly and attentive . the highlight , of course , is the menu . they offer	3
i 'm not quite sure why the restaurant is categorized under `` salads '' and `` vegetarian . '' i do n't know that the menu has any more salad or vegetarian items than most other restaurants . that aside , i really wanted to love the greene house ,	2
stax has become my favorite old town lunch spot and i 'm not usually a burger type of gal . the food here is really good . i love the variety of burgers -lrb- veggie , turkey , kobe , exotic , etc -rrb- and the fact that you can	3
are you one that 's too embarrassed to sing karaoke in front of strangers ?! geisha a go go could be the place for you ! they offer a few rooms that fit 10 + people , so you can invite just those friends that you do n't mind embarrassing	3
a friend of mine has been raving about this place for a while now , and with good reason ! i was finally able to go here for breakfast over the weekend . while my friends raved about their twist on french toast , i have to admit that was	3

i always enjoy trying new places . the burgers were good and the menu includes a wide variety of burger options . good beer selection as well . service was a little slow , but we arrived at the same time as a large group that took up half the	3
i have been here twice now and i am not real impressed . the fish was not very flavorful and one of the friends with us actually had really undercooked halibut . he didnt even want to order anything else as the first bite was enough for him to be	2
this is a great spot for lunch . the patio is a nice place to sit for a business lunch or even a casual chat with a friend . the ahi tuna tacos were excellent . the tacos come with all of the ingredients separate so you can put as	3
the staff is so nice ! some friends of mine threw an art and music thing there a few days ago and we had a blast . the place is laid out nice , it has 2 stages and ample smoking patio space with misters and seating ! -lrb- thats	3
the only reason they dont get 1 star is because i understand they are n't accustomed to the heavier side of music and prolly <unk> a bit when the bad brains came through . that said , this place bites . 1 . they blocked off half the seating ,	1
can i just say , i hate everything about this store . if youre too lazy to go to goodwill and dig it out yourself for a third of the price , then i guess this is the place for you . if you are trying to sell anything ,	1
when i want a completely over indulged , <unk> , -lrb- what diet ? -rrb- meal i come here . i love lolo 's . the staff is warm and friendly . there 's usually a wait -lrb- scottsdale location -rrb- , but it moves fast and is so worth	3

had an absolutely spectacular experience from start to finish , what a fabulous score for old town dining ! we went for happy hour and it is by far the best happy hour in town ! they offer a nice selection of wines by the glass for $ 5 each	4
the sushi last night was excellent . i got the roll with soft shell crab and eel sauce -lrb- ca n't look up the name because they have no online menu -rrb- sushi was fresh , rice was perfect , the roll was nice and stuffed they do n't give	4
this place is amazing . mac n cheese , thirsty <unk> , good music , eclectic crowd , right off the lite rail what else could you want ! the staff here is so personable , they remember your name , what you like to drink & they greet you	4
service is slow , i waited 27 mins just to place my order . my wings were pretty good but they are over over priced to say the least , for what 5 small wings cost here i could pay a few more dollars and get a dozen somewhere else	1
tj 's is a nice grocery store ... clean and convenient . it 's unfortunate that a whole foods is so <unk> located and not all that local , but in the mean time i find everything i need between here and the safeway on camelback and 32nd street .	3
went back in the evening for some more of the delicious bruschetta ! this time i went with another friend and we shared that plus the artichoke dip and a sandwich . we over ordered , but i wanted to try something new this time . he wanted the ``	3
i 've tried their smashchicken and smashburger , but love their smashfries . their burgers are tasty , but as a sucker for yummy fries ... i go here mainly for those when i 'm craving something salty and well , not so good for you - but definitely tasty	3
this place is an amazing place for timid to see what all the buzz is about sushi ! i have been around the block w / sushi . the fun thing about sushi is that its all about the rice and seaweed -lrb- <unk> -rrb- . you do n't have	3
this place is a work in progress . the most important part is that 1 . they actually have an establishment now and 2 . people are going to it ! : -rrb- i was inspired by watching `` killer at large ... '' a documentary about how us americans	2
this place kicks ass in the customer service area ! the waiter was swift taking orders , refilling drinks , bringing the food , and the bill . the special was couscous with some veggies and a mystery red sauce . did n't matter it was good . it almost	3

go at 11:30 for lunch - parking is a breeze and easy to get a seat . but they wo n't seat you unless your entire party is there , even if all but 4 tables in the entire place are <unk> . there were more people waiting for the	3
i seem to forget about lenny 's for my lunch break . i 've only been here once and i really enjoyed my cheeseburger . it 's a tiny , busy burger <unk> on central ave. it 's quick too -- they got me in and out and happily fed	3

alex ` is is the perfect place to bring a client . they serve dinner and lunch . the nice atmosphere is conducive for conversation and eating . there is massive lightrail construction going on in <unk> of the restaurant though so getting in and out is not as easy	4
gon na have to do 3 stars on this one . i 've had in my opinion 5 star sushi and this is not it , but it is still good . i am reading all about this <unk> <unk> service staff but i must have gone on the day	2
our server was very very nice and very accommodating . i liked her a lot . we all liked her a lot . the sushi was plentiful and came on this gigantic boat that was kinda fun . the price was right . but why not more stars ? it	2
oh the bulk bins ... i love the bulk <unk> but i hate them all at the same time . i love that it is so cheap and tasty but i hate that all it takes is one quick cough or sneeze and you can take home lucy <unk> <unk>	3
okay , so it looks like this place is hit and miss and i have an idea why ... ... because people have different expectations on this whole car wash thing . so if you are super picky and have so many <unk> in your car , why not just	3

it 's unfortunate that some of my favorite stores are no longer in the biltmore and it 's remodel by <unk> makes it look like all the other strip malls in az . ... what happened to the old phoenix charm ? where did it go ? rumor has it	1
completely mediocre and boring actually . nothing great , nothing bad -- just cpk . it 's there if you are hungry .	2
i have <unk> great time when i go to kobalt . it must be something they put in the drinks or maybe it 's the 9th drink or maybe it 's the good company . this gay bar is my kind of gay bar . i sang karaoke here once	3
this location has become my # 1 favorite location in phoenix . i used to go to the one at town & country because it used to be closer to where i live , but it was always so congested in there -- like crazy busy that it seemed to	4

i 'm not a fan of cowboy ciao . i know a lot of people love it , but i 'm just not one of them . people love the chopped salad , but i do n't care for salmon , so i do n't really care for the salad	1
loved coming here for a recent yelp event ! i have n't been here in a few years . it 's definitely a museum for older kids , so my little ones wo n't be visiting here for a few years . i was able to finally visit body works	3

this place is absolutely , positively perfect in every conceivable way . why , you ask , is this place perfect in every conceivable way ? well ... my friends ... let me tell you . 1 . big <unk> <unk> mix wine - it costs three dollars and it	4
one time , before we became `` official , '' i walked into a uye at bomberos and gave dallas g a high five . that 's right , instead of a hug or kiss on the cheek for the man who had graced the sheets of my bed many	4
since the veggie house turned into loving hut , i have been twice , and am very delighted at some of the positive changes that have occurred . the space itself is much lighter , and i feel more welcome by the staff . i also like that their food	3
i really enjoyed lisa g 's . i went with a bunch of other <unk> 's and <unk> 's after the last oye and was pleasantly surprised . i have driven by several times and i love the logo and the sign , and used to live within walking distance	3
i have eaten at the veggie house several times . the food is good , but the service is normally pretty slow . do not head here if you are in a rush . i normally get sweet and sour pork . pretty tasty dish . i have tried some	3
if i liked beer , four peaks would be getting five stars . -lrb- i will say they have a peach ale that is realllly tasty !! -rrb- i wish i were my dad right now -lrb- that 's creepy , i know -rrb- because his cabinet shop is literally	3
i absolutely love kiss the cook . it is the cutest little place for breakfast and i love going here . the quaint little restaurant is decorated with country antiques and most of them are for sale . it reminds me of a place you would find in prescott .	4
the fact that i have yet to write my review of nami should be an insult to vegans and sweet lovers everywhere ! nami , short for tsoynami , is heaven on earth . or the moon . <unk> . wherever there is heaven , there is nami . soy	4
this book store is absolutely amazing . literally all of their books are half priced , but that does n't mean they are the sucky type of books you find in the clearance section of borders . they do have an awesome $ 1 clearance section with a shit load	4
i can not stand this mall . they have some really awesome stores but the people who work in them are obnoxious . most of the people walking around are snooty as can be , and everything is overpriced . the food court has some good selection , but is	1
this is the exact place i love to hate . but i ca n't . i can not hate you , lodge . i just ca n't ! in fact , if this place did n't have <unk> animals -lrb- yes , i just made a word up -rrb- and	3
i love sens a five star now . i would say that there was a complete turnaround in 2.5 months . service issues are fixed , they pour a mean vodka tonic , the wasabi tofu has maintained its amazing tastiness and i really like the location . now if	4

great beer , great burger , great atmosphere . they do what they do and they do it very well . love the hefeweizen and the kilt lifter . love the southwestern burger . parking is not easy , had to park a couple blocks away . did not love	3
after hearing several friends talk about the place son and i thought it would be an interesting place to take my wife for for mothers day . we expected it to be crowded and it was . i 'm not sure what i expected but it was not what what	2
i can tell i 'm getting old . i go to restaurants for the food not because it is the thing to do . i met some friends at the true foods because they heard good things . a lot of beautiful people were eating there . looked like a	1
my sister and i ate here exactly a month ago . it is under new ownership and is so much better ! the old owners were rude and service was very sloppy and bad . my sister and i each ordered the same item - egg and cheese breakfast sandwich	3
the blue moose is a fun place to go to hang out with friends and enjoy some good conversation and some decent food . i have been going off and on to the `` moose '' for almost 6 years . the staff is friendly and the service is great	3
duke 's is my place to grab some lunch when i want to get away from the same old grind of a sandwich . the food is okay and has always been fresh when i have eaten here with co-workers . the hot wings , burgers , sandwiches , and	2
i went here today with a buddy of mine for lunch and it was definitely a very good meal . overall quality was pretty damn good . the thing i loved the best about this place was that they have duck on the buffet line !! i have never seen	3
i have been eying this place for quite some time now considering one of my best friends has checked in here 28 times , and one of my other friends just discovered it and was ranting about it . so last night i had to give it a whirl .	4
i came here on saturday night for my first time . i would describe smashburger as elevated fast food , almost chipotle like in design . it was a very nicely decorated facility and the service was great . a pretty expansive menu for this type of place . a	2
this whole complex is great ! if the dbacks were to actually play regular season games here , i 'd be more inclined to go to because i do not like chase field . just walking up to the actual stadium you walk right by numerous playing fields , and	4
i love when my <unk> are proved wrong . i have actually heard a lot about this place and i know what pho is but actually never tried it until yesterday . walking up to this place , you have the misconception that this place will not be that good	3
i came here for a pre dinner drink before going to fnb . my date and i went in and went straight to the bar . i 'm not going to bitch because i was n't greeted by anyone , i could care less . we sat at the bar	0
ok i do n't understand america 's recent craze with cupcakes . the show cupcake wars and i have heard so many grand things about sprinkles . i had today off and i decided i had to see what the whole cupcake buzz is about . when i walked in	2
gigantic bar , good hh spot . extensive menu with standard bar fare . starters <unk> the entrees . nachos , boneless buffalo wings , onion rings were decent . pass on the hummus plate . good service , but would probably just return for large draft selection .	2
3.5 stars - overall pleased , would <unk> as a happy hr . standby , rated <unk> b/c food was decent , not <unk> . quite pleasantly surprised to discover this airy , spacious <unk> in scottsdale fashion <unk> . stopped in during happy hr . on a thursday ,	2

there is nothing to say that has n't been said . if you like good wine , food and service check out postino . i would recommend the bruschetta and the roasted beet salad .	4
mediocre to the max with bad service to boot ! i 've given this place a handful of tries and i just ca n't seem to find anything i like . the service is probably the worst part . waiting 10 minutes for sushi rolls that are clearly ready and	1
went back . still amazing . i ate kangaroo !!!!	4
the food has really gone downhill . i used to go here all the time when i lived on that side of town but the last few times i 've gone the sushi was horrible . maybe it was an off day ? i might venture back to see if	1
this is a nice place -- the service is normally good and the staff is very friendly . the location is great because it is walking distance for some of the offices in the area and there are not many other offerings unless you want to hoof it all the	3
overall very happy with this location . i will say straight away that they do have some growing pains -- the location has been very popular right from the start and it takes a lot of work to grease all the <unk> and get a very busy restaurant working properly	3
this place is great and a lot of fun . we ventured over here on a whim because we were waiting for a show at the rhythm room across the way and the traditional rack shack bbq was closed and locked . the decor is quite fantastic and this little	3
<unk> <unk> on a popsicle stick . ever eat a <unk> meal and then want to start all over again because it was just that damned good ? this place is a home run in every sense . not just a regular home run , but one of the ones	4
despite working about a mile away from this place for 7 years , i 've never gone inside , mostly because i 'm scared of places that are the only <unk> business in an entire plaza of empty stalls . i always think they must be moving <unk> <unk> cars	3
i ca n't speak to the various deluxe and mixed concoctions available here , but the basic drip coffee is excellent . every time i 've been here i order just a drip coffee , black . if you add cream and sugar you are going to <unk> the taste	3
an update is long overdue , since i originally rated arriba two stars . i 've been back a few times since , and they have really made a lot of strides toward improving the food and the service . the servers are more `` on '' these days ,	3
in me and my friend 's minds , this is the best pizza place in phoenix metro . i 'm surprised to hear that people feel that the food is not good and overpriced and that they have gotten horrible service . the food : the pizza here is amazing	4
yum ! the food here is always good and it 's a decent price . the owner is really nice and always makes sure that your experience is wonderful . i always get something with gyro meat and it 's usually great . during lunch rush , sometimes the <unk>	3
this is a really great library and probably the best in phoenix ! among the beautiful architectural elements , this place has a pretty descent selection of books and music . there are different levels of the building that gives a great <unk> . there are lots of areas that	4
this place is pretty cool . it 's a real chill atmosphere and there are n't an overwhelming amount of people there -lrb- which i like ! -rrb- . i showed up to meet some friends on a friday night . the inside is great , there is a big	3
yum yum yum ! i love this place 's breakfast burrito and their carne asada . for some reason , the first time i went to the 7th st location , i did n't like it . however , i came back after about 6 months and now i am	4
all i can say is , i really hope this place was having a bad day . i was really hoping this place would be good . i loved their sign out front and was hoping for a new place to go ... but i guess not . when you	1
if the food is terrible when you are drunk late at night , then you know something is wrong . this past weekend i went to this place for the final time . i 've had their cheesesteaks a number of times now and they have gotten worse and worse	0
after attending this year 's burger battle and speaking with lindsey f. about how great lobby 's burgers are , this place has been on my radar for a while now . i do n't get to tempe very often , but when i did , i was going to	3
this is my new favorite place to go to at the new city scape in downtown phoenix . the food , drinks , music , and atmosphere are all great . copper blues is the perfect decision for <unk> drinks and dinner . the restaurant is attached to the stand	3
upon arriving at phoenix municipal stadium i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this facility . it was easy to get to from the 202 , easy parking -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , and a nice view of the papago rocks over the left field wall . the one	3
i 've been wanting to try the parlor for months and i finally got to on friday for date night with my girlfriend . i 've heard so many good things about this place so i was expecting greatness , but worried i would be disappointed due to all the	3
one of the only chinese places i like in the valley . i always go with the # 12 lunch combo , the chicken and broccoli . it is delicious and the spring rolls are great too . i highly recommend siu wok if you 're looking for a chinese	3
one of the best spring training sites , second only to salt river fields in my opinion . scottsdale stadium is home to the sf giants and is the best location of all the stadiums . it has a great seating and lawn area . post game day drinking is	4
yay , a hole-in-the-wall mexican joint that 's vegetarian-friendly ! my kid and i loved the -lrb- homemade ? -rrb- horchata , <unk> and all -- even better that its served <unk> -lrb- <unk> ? -rrb- - style . i had the bean and cheese burrito , served some special	3
fantastic pizza and smiling service . i 'm pretty sure that mr. bianco 's special ingredient is love .	4
took my girl to <unk> for her birthday last night -lrb- not that it 's a <unk> restaurant , more that it 's a quaint downtown spot without a wait and decent outdoor seating -rrb- . it was our second time there and we had a great time . they	3
this is the best pita jungle and it 's not just because they have a full bar . the waitstaff seems to care more about your experience much more than the other valley locations . i recommend the lentil <unk> salad and the lavosh pizza -lrb- ? -- may have	4
i admit i 'm not a huge bbq fan , as it usually makes me feel like exploding afterwards but since my dining partner loves bbq , we 've eaten here a lot . the meat is pretty good but at least one of the meats has been dry each	2
this little spot can get really packed . the first time i was here there was a 20 minute wait . the 2nd time the restaurant was full , even though it was pretty late -lrb- about noon -rrb- on sunday . the coffee was excellent , strong and dark	3
i have to admit , i normally do n't like chinese food . in fact , it 's just about the only style of food i have n't fallen in love with at some point in my life . this is a real problem when you live with someone that	4
as much as i like gameworks , you ca n't drink and drive at gameworks ! i like the fact you can drink , drink , drink to your hearts content and then play video games with other stupidly drunk adults at dave and buster 's ! i 've been	3
this place has been recommended to me by family and friends so many times . as an arizona native , i 'm ashamed that i had n't been here sooner . it took a friend coming into town to get me to go and i 'm so glad i did	3
i decided to give green a few other tries . i 've been back for the soynami 's multiple times even . they are very good , almost unbelievable how they make them taste . they do n't have that nasty nutty soy aftertaste that seriously makes me want to	2
i really love bookmans . their huge selection of used books is the best in the valley . in many instances they have a much broader selection of <unk> books , in store , than all the retail chains , and i 've found that even when the retail chains	4
alright boys , get past the fact that it 's a little chick centric , arcadia farms is a great place to grab a light bite , but leave feeling satisfied and content . my group of 3 split the hummus appetizer , and wholly garbanzo bean batman , it	3

you guys have no idea how long i debated whether or not to leave a review for little woody . it was pretty much a goal of mine to keep it as secret for as long as i possibly could , mostly because the place is n't that big ,	4

this place is just okay - nothing amazing . we have liked our food here , but it was nothing out of this world .	2
we had a burger and the asian shrimp dish , and both were not good . some of the prices were reasonable , but some were definitely overpriced . the drinks are super expensive too ! other friends at our table also thought that the food was not very good	1
very friendly service and nice atmosphere . they also allowed me to order the kid 's bean & cheese burrito , which was only $ 4 and very large ! it was also very good . hopefully i will be able to return in the future to try more of	3

eh , this place is not too good . i definitely would n't choose to return here . the food is just ok , which makes it way overpriced for what it is . nothing on the menu is special or unique . we also felt like our stomachs were	1
i would give this place more stars if the prices were lower or the food was better . unfortunately , expensive prices for mediocre food is not for me . we tried 5 dishes here , and neither of us were excited about any of them . the calamari was	1
the food here was very good and fresh ! we were able to try multiple things off of the menu - guacamole , soup , white bean side , salads , and tacos . we just loved the decor of this place ! all the leather was beautiful . we	3
very good food and service ! we got a delicious brussel sprout salad with salmon as well as the french dip . it was not our absolute favorite french dip , but it was definitely one of the better ones we have had . their <unk> dessert was absolutely amazing	3
this place is just okay . the food was decent , but it is overpriced for what you get . also , our server was not very attentive at all . it was a busy night , but he hardly came to our table , and when he was there	2

how many great things can one say about the cartel ? does <unk> work ! yes , that was a statement , not a question . i am in love with the cc , hands down . i have traded my gold starbucks card in for this amazingly delicious start	4

i do n't get it . i thought for the amount of food we got and the quality that it was overpriced . tried the veggie burger . the flavor was fine but it was very thin and crumbly and made a terrible mess . did not like the smash	1
decent lunch . had the vegetarian platter . my favorite was the baba ganoush . easy to find coupons for ... including the entertainment book . the greek fries sound tasty .	2
great , friendly service . loved the potato latkes for breakfast . and the bagel ! mmmm ... i 'm a carb girl .	3
i thought the best part was the ambiance outside by the waterfall . the second best part was the pomegranate margarita . the third best part was my portobello mushroom burger with chipotle mayonnaise .	3
is it just me or does costco have the best hot dogs ?!?! yum !!!	3
great service . nice ambiance . so glad they have kids meals now . last time i was there -lrb- long time ago -rrb- they did n't . so your child can eat for between $ 2.95 and $ 4.95 , including a drink . the happy hour is decent	3
i have been twice now . the thing that <unk> me as soon as i walk in the door is the smell of baby poop . i have no idea what <unk> the smell but it is very strong . my children noticed and mentioned it to me the moment	1
my two stars is for the food and ordering process . i still thing going to the restaurant to experience the organ and bring friends or visitors is a must . they only accept cash or check and that is always inconvenient . very few places do n't take debit	1
this is the best . if you do n't eat diary you ca n't beat how wonderful the fruit flavors are ... how can they be dairy free ? yummy !!	4
food was good . greasy but good . the price of the small glass of fresh <unk> orange juice was silly expensive but it was tasty . i had an omelet with sauteed mushrooms and onions and cheddar cheese with wheat toast and preserves as well as home fries .	2

i like this mall . i like the wildflower bread co. , see 's <unk> , auntie anne 's , <unk> toys , the pet store , build a bear , apple store , nordstroms , kiddie <unk> , ect ect . i think they have a decent food court	4
i ate here for the second time last night . the $ 5 off $ 20 coupon in the entertainment book sealed the deal . the restaurant has changed the menu a bit and added 3 vegetarian options to the menu . the lemon grass rice noodles that i previously	3
i wanted to hate this place . there is n't that much parking . it is packed with only a few big picnic tables to sit outside and eat . it was to hot to eat outside , imo which meant i had to take my sandwhich to go .	4
i was told that this place was no longer cash only and that the service and toddy had gotten better . that person was right about 2 of those things . the guy and girl who were working on the morning i decided to give this place another shot were	1
athenian express has a huge selection of things to chose from . they have salads , burgers , gyros , pasta , subs , and pitas ! there are also lots of vegetarian items . their hummus is out of this world . they make it fresh every morning and	3

i 'll keep this short and sweet . snobby waiters/waitresses ridiculous wait times delicious pizza service is an important part of a dining experience but it 's not everything , hence why they only lose 1 star from me . there 's not a whole lot they can do about	3
cheba hut is a place i love and hate . i love the quality of the sandwiches and the fact they 're toasted ! they have veggie options and all kinds of sides and unique drinks , and a variety of tasty desserts . i hate how it can be	1
i only gave this joint three stars because of their classic cocktail menu . not many bartenders make old <unk> or singapore <unk> anymore , and i love the fact that they have a variety of old drinks , plus a huge list of good scotch and other spirits .	2
i could n't find anything wrong with avanti . five starts across the board ! to starters , the decor is amazing . it is right out of a scene in <unk> , or even <unk> . think elegant 80s chic , right down to the <unk> striped chairs .	4

this place makes me a happy girl . it 's just bonus that it 's next to the trader joe 's i frequent . they sell both new and used books which imo is pretty awesome . they have a decent selection of used books but not the best or	4

ugh , these places are terrible . i 'm not really sure why the husband and i decided to give them another shot , maybe because they 're in a nicer part of town or maybe we were just being nice , who knows . we decided to go inside	1

some good things and some bad things about this place , first the <unk> hour prices are good 1/2 price beer and wine , the <unk> prices are too high with small pours . food was cheap but lacking any real pizzazz , you pay for what you get .	2
north scottsdale sports bar type atmosphere . great four peaks beers but the food is certainly subpar when compared to the main brewery in tempe . the advantage it has over tempe is that it has air conditioning but beyond that tempe is the four peaks to hit .	2
sort of like a poor mans version of ruth chris 's steak house or a rich mans version of frasher 's steak house . food was good but not great . service was very good . plenty of wine choices but very limited beer menu . i find it a	3

it was a well-priced happy hour for an upscale place , but i found the offerings to be quite limited . burger was just okay , salt & pepper shrimp was accompanied by green bean fries , but they were all covered in the same soggy batter .	2

this place would make my grandma proud to live in az if she was still around drinking a bud light and playing the slots : -rrb- the buffet was to die for , but a little pricey at 25 a head . the cigar room was perfect with a well	3

we came back for lunch , to treat our <unk> to lunch for <unk> professional 's day . we all had pho , she had chicken and me and my friend had the saigon pho i think , which is the one with beef , tripe and <unk> ... it	3
what ? i never reviewed baby kay 's ? unbelievable ! well , there is not much i can say because every time we go there we end up ordering the same thing ! haha ... and that is the cajun combination : chicken gumbo , crawfish etouffee , chicken	3
stopped here for late dinner after movie -lrb- 9pm on a tuesday -rrb- they were not busy and we were seated promptly . danny was our server , we had water and diet coke . we had the bread to start -lrb- nothing to write home about -rrb- hummus appetizer	3
beers ! good ones ! on tap ! lots of them ! <unk> ! fake ones ! on the servers ! most of them ! -lrb- oh yeah , and music and comedy and food and stuff too -rrb-	3
holy cow . i could be a <unk> if only the method of <unk> was eating the object of <unk> . -lrb- which i guess makes my true natural religion <unk> , but that 's another story -rrb- ` <unk> ^ -rcb- the half priced , half kobe , half	3
brought my family in for dinner on a saturday , and we were literally treated like guests in their home . this great , family-run , independant , unique eatery is just what everyone hopes for in their <unk> . if you 're not in the <unk> , do n't	4
this new place is not your average fast-food <unk> style gyro joint , at all . it 's so much better ... this is a fast casual <unk> dining version of one of those restaurants . the place is an oasis of clean and cozy considering the strip mall location	4
<unk> microbrews - oh yea . hiking with <unk> recently one evening was <unk> wonderfully with a tasty ale on their shaded patio . sure it was warm , but we were together - a boy and his dog and his beer . beautiful , man , beautiful .	4
make whatever jokes you want about the name as if you 're a <unk> 7th grade boy , but dick 's hideaway has really got a great menu of american food . might not be a burger , fry , and shake diner , but new mexican cuisine is american	3
in short : awful food with no imagination , go at your own <unk> . i was in downtown phoenix and it was pretty late so decided to drop by this place . looked ok from the outside but i should have walked out as soon as i walked in	0
in short : average sushi , not much imagination , but the happy hour is awesome . i probably would n't go here on a regular basis if the happy hour is n't so good . the location is pretty nice as well , conveniently located around the heart of	2
in short : great quality ingredients and they stay true to their products but pretty much everything is overpriced . i like their food , good quality ingredients prepared in a way that brings out the best of them . not much frills but the flavours are decent but not	2

chicago memories from a hot dog and big beef okay , that lead line sounds horrible , but it 's accurate . my wife and i loved portillo 's when we lived in chicago . cheap , good eats and an authentic chicago dog . my father-in-law spent decades loving	3
fun shopping site for high-end stores kierland commons has some uncommon stores ad restaurants that we visit on occasion . ipic is the best movie experience in town . i 'm a fan of true foods and zinc bistro . they have the best apple store in the region .	3

got the # 13 tom yum soup , which was salty to almost <unk> , with shrimp cooked to within an inch of their life , pretty poor example of this type of soup the # 54 pad thai was done reasonably well , however the menu states chicken and	1

i can not explain how much i love the food here , especially the fungi pizza . <unk> . they have a great happy hour menu from 3-6 and all day sunday , which i appreciate . the service is hit and miss . if only they could be more	3
ok , this place is expensive . like $ 50 bucks for 1 kid 2 adults and that 's just to walk in . plus the planetarium and any extras . on the other hand , it was a full day worth of fun and exploration . totally worth it	3
the list of things that makes this place awesome can go on and on . the service is top notch , you will never be in need of anything . the food , beyond outstanding . i love the filet mignon chopped salad . this salad will move you ,	4
this was my second visit and my last . i 'm a die hard lover of sushi and all things thai and man oh man when you get a bad serving of either one of those , you will never return and that is what happened on this occasion .	2
first visit was during happy hour on a friday at the scottsdale quarter . let me just say , best damn happy hour around and not just cause of the drink specials . the sushi specials can not be beat , dragon roll or las vegas roll for $ 6	4
i love love love , did i mention love fox concept restaurants ? having said that , i have to admit i was a bit disappointed by the menu and this location in general . it was just mediocre . nothing about it was bad and nothing about it was	2
this place is always beyond packed , even when the doors open . on this particular visit , i was one of 15 people waiting in line when the doors opened . i had just come out from a movie , was hungry and wanted the grilled chicken and hummus	2

i like centurion . it 's got more space now after their expansion , and it 's a quirky , unusual experience . you feel really close to the kitchen and chefs , and the food is always good . it 's terrific that after 5pm weekday and all day	3
i 'm a cheap bastard with expensive tastes . so my reviews are geared toward getting somewhat `` foody '' dishes at what i consider reasonable prices . with that said , thirteen north gets one of my very rare 5 star reviews . i only dined there once ,	4
went there for lunch . split a chopped salad and a deviled eggs . large portions . salad was a bit heavy on sauce , but i liked it . deviled eggs had some truffle oil which made them pretty good . burger was gigantic . ordered onion rings that	1
downside is you pay for street parking . and tiny , tiny inside area where the owner claims he can squeeze in 25 people , but more than 10 is entirely too close for comfort . go there when nice outside so you have best options . food is generally	3

super fast delivery ... curry beef was amazing ! large portions for the money !	4

the best fast food burger hands down . ca n't beat leaving there for $ 5 and feeling stuffed . i always get the country burger or the mexican burger .	4
being from la , im a huge fan of the diy <unk> experience so i was pretty sad to learn that most <unk> places in az didnt let you cook your own stuff on the table . well , i was sad until a friend suggested we try takamatsu !	4
came here for a little wine and dinner with violeta h. the other night . what a cute place ! the decor is adorable and comfortable . chairs are soft and comfy and the place is low lit but not too dark where you ca n't see your dining companion	3
first of all ... happy hour every day . how could you go wrong with that ? especially when they have a great selection of beers -lrb- domestic and craft from the area -rrb- that come in pitchers for just $ 5 . awesome . service was outstanding . everyone	4

it makes me sad to say this , since i was so excited to pay a visit to this cute little place occupying what was once a <unk> shop across the street from my high school , but i was not really impressed with lux . i went twice in	2
my family and i parked our asses at the breakfast bar after a 45 minute wait . and had a perfect breakfast . <unk> was delightful to chat with , but more importantly , the breakfasts were spot on . great cakes , great scramble , amazing chunky breakfast potatoes	4
best burger in town , best beet salad ever . fries to die for . banana split off the hook . groovy ambience for dinner , casual chic for lunch . my most recent trip , took a business partner for lunch . wait was <unk> at 12:30 , and	4
first trip to the new <unk> 's <unk> was solid . for those of you who never had the privilege of visiting the original scottsdale <unk> 's when it was quality , it was a place with a beachy feel in old town scottsdale that served unique sandwiches , salads	3

stopped in for a quick drink & instantly fell in love with the place . loved how they had fresh ingredients . i ca n't remember the name of my drink -lrb- it had kale , cucumber , ginger , etc -rrb- but i loved it - very refreshing !	3
3.5 stars pretty good gelato chain restaurant with a decent selection of gelatos at normal prices .	2
although i 'm no chicago native , i 've been there and can say that this place does n't do chicago dogs justice . we ordered the jumbo chili cheese dog , italian beef , fries , and a burger . everything just tasted okay . the italian beef was	2
loved their portobello sandwich ! the pizza is pretty good as well although not quite like a ny pizza : -rrb-	3
my husband and i brought my mom here when she was visiting to grab breakfast . they were a bit unorganized . the food was okay , but the service was pretty slow -lrb- constantly had to flag down someone for refills of coffee -rrb- , but they were nice	2
went around 10:30 on a sunday morning and did n't wait much more than 20 minutes for a table for 2 -lrb- first available . -rrb- very <unk> service to place orders and receive food -- a little slower on drink refills . the prices are decent for the location	3

i do n't get it . why the fuss or the great reviews ? i 've gone to various locations - phoenix , tempe , shea blvd. . i do n't understand why people will wait 30-45 minutes to eat here ? the service is n't bad , the atmosphere	1
it 's ok . not great . but ok . especially if you live in the south mountain area where we do n't have many selections of restaurants to choose from . my favorite is the honey seared chicken . they also have a great kids menu if you have	2
i 'm only half asian so i 'm not sure if my opinion counts . tho the price is cheap and the service is lightning fast the food does not stack up . yet the place was packed . there was enough oil on my food for me to deep	1
had a hard time finding this place at night but its definitely worth the drive . parking is also slim but valet is available . this small place comes with excellent customer service and most of all good ice cream !!! will be back for more vietnamese coffee and butter	3
this place is a must for the true buffalo -lrb- the city -rrb- style hotdog lover , plain simple , yet satisfying . but be prepared , this place does not do any other <unk> besides hard earned cash !! btw there is an bofa atm machine a stone <unk>	3
i want to like this place . i really do . it 's near by , it 's local , it 's efficient , and it 's reasonably priced and seems to be a <unk> against the big chain burger guys . it 's just not that great . while	1
good . cheap . tasty . 24/7 . drive through . that sums this place up . highlights : their carnitas platter comes in a styrofoam plate with beans , rice , and two giant tortillas , weighs quite literally 2 lbs , and is enough to put two people	3
i 'd recommend this place highly for two situations : 1 . -rrb- you are on the west side of town and you want some reasonably priced grub , 2 . -rrb- you 've never had vietnamese food and you want to try it out in a <unk> environment .	2
i only give five stars to places that i have been multiple times and been consistently impressed by both the products and the service . it has to be a place that i would absolutely recommend to anyone , any time . it has to be , dollar for dollar	4
i like simple places . the downfall of many restaurants -lrb- imho -rrb- is attempting to do too much . rather than stick to what they can excel at , many owners try to extend themselves into arenas where they should not go . this strategy is usually driven by	3
worst service i 've had in a long time . the waitress was snotty and literally could n't do the basic math necessary for me to pay my bill -lrb- gave her a $ 20 bill and she sat there like ` um , 20 minus <unk> is ... uh	0
i went to bosa donuts around 6 am on friday . they had a good selection , and quite a lot of everything that they had . however other reviewers talked a lot about <unk> fresh the doughnuts were and how good they were . i got 4 doughnuts and	2
the best pho in phx , hands down ! the owners are super nice and totally <unk> to <unk> and changes . i love it !	4
if original hamburger works became a trendy chain with modern decor , it would be smashburger . the burgers , fries and shoestring onions are tasty . for some reason the place smells like raw sewage however . i 'm not sure what that is all about . good burger	2
if you enjoy being <unk> in a tiny space with middle aged wannabe rich women while screaming <unk> babies run <unk> through the store this place is for you .	0
excellent food . good atmosphere . do n't let the outside fool you , the prime is quite possibly the best chinese food in the state .	4
bookman 's is kept up much better than any other used book store i know . they have a nice selection of used electronics as well .	3
it is what it is - very good fast food mexican restaurant in south phoenix .	3
best sushi ever ! great happy hour too . 3-6 and <unk> they have $ 5 rolls and cheap drinks . they have some unique sushi . my favorite is the heart attack ! the environment is really nice too . you wo n't be disappointed by trying this one	4
this is a perfect place to make a quick stop on your way home to grab some milk , eggs , produce or other basic needs . it is a little more pricy than a chain grocery store of course , but you are supporting local farms and businesses when	4
i have to preface that every time i 've visited this location it has been after midnight and i might have been pretty intoxicated . with that said , yummy yummy drunken food ! i love that they are open after the bars close . i love to get a	4
this place is heavenly !!! i have dreams about it on a regular basis . the cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors . tasty !	4
the reviews for here are spot on . the food was okay . yummy margaritas ! okay salsa , but not great . overcooked chips . but considering we live in phoenix there is no need to waste your time eating here . there are hundreds of better mexican food	1
if you 're not in a rush this place is great ! i went for breakfast and it was really good . the menu is pretty unique . there are tons of things i still want to try ! but it took forever for them to come and take our	3
great pizza and the best red velvet cake i 've ever had !	4
let me start off by saying , this place is awesome !!!! i had the filet medium rare and it was one of the best filets i 've had . the lobster mashed potatoes are a must . it was my favorite part of the meal . huge chunks of	4
was n't super impressed . the seafood was alright , but for the price i would expect it to be amazing . would n't ever come back .	2
i like this bww . i 've had great service every time i have been here . the boneless wings are great and their selection of bear on tap is great . come during happy hour and you can get a large beer for the price of a small .	3
i 've been to this olive garden quite a few times , dining in and to-go . overall , the food is on par with other olive gardens and the service is good . i would recommend this place if you are in the mood for olive garden . my	3

the first time i ate here was at their friends and family pre-opening event . now , in the interest of full disclosure , i was neither friends nor family at that point -lrb- i was discussing a book event with wendy -rrb- , though in typical <unk> fashion i	4
underwhelming - that 's the only word for it . i was really sad about that , too . i went with great expectations of an `` old school '' evening out . the decor did n't disappoint . the dark , heavy furnishings work well in the dim lighting	2
cool , italian pizza place . my husband loves the pizza here . the service is always 5 star . i wish they had more food choices , esp better salads .	3
the service was good . they have some specials for happy hour . overall though the quality of the food compared with price was lacking . nice , authentic feeling mom and pop place though .	2
awesome concept . upscale ambiance . unique gourmet entrees . very expensive . do n't go here if you are really hungry . the portions are small and pricey . come here for good customer service and food that you ca n't get at the chain restaurants . be prepared	3
i 'm going to be honest , i 'll probably be a fan of any buffet . i like <unk> my salad -lrb- where would i be able to order one with hard boiled eggs , corn , bell peppers and one cucumber slice ? -rrb- and getting a random	3
postino 's is a great place for a date or evening out with friends . the arcadia location is in a cool neighborhood and the building opens up on one side to an outdoor patio ... which is awesome on an evening with nice weather . i have to admit	4
i had never heard of crackers until i visited , and i did n't realize it was a chain until just now ! i have been seriously missing out . fiance and i stopped by for lunch , having been called in from the street by the signage . my	3
i 'm always a fan of mimis . breakfast , lunch , dinner ... it 's all good . my old go-to was the french dip with au jus , which had such tender beef . more recently i have expanded my palette , and i also come more often	3
both times i 've been to the sushi room so far , was with a groupon . due to groupon rules , any happy hour items we ordered did n't apply to our available balance , but it looked like some good deals . i 'd probably only return if	2
native new yorker knows their wings ! i would only come here for the wings , and the wings are why i come here . that , and it 's a decent place to sit and hang out with some friends , and maybe watch a game -lrb- or 7	3
i am a fan of amazing noodles and fun fusion dishes , so when a friend of mine told me about this place being his favorite joint and invited me to go , i jumped on it like white on rice . noodles ranch is located in the bashas complex	4

so , i am cheating right now . i actually tried this place via catering one day -- so i have no clue what their business looks like , whether or not they 've cleaned their tables properly or if it smells funny . the only thing dirty is how	3
pei wei is like a fast-food version of pf changs -lrb- same <unk> -rrb- . there is something that is a must for anybody trying pei wei for the first time : lettuce wraps . absolutely worth the trip alone . i normally get this for myself as my entree	3
excellent burger ! i had a classic smashburger and order of smash fries . the burger was very juicy and tasty and the toppings were fresh . not the best burger i 've ever had , but pretty dang good . the smashfries are very good - but a very	2

i do n't know what it is about phoenix , but you ca n't seem to find a decent donut shop here . bosa seems to be about the best option we have , and while it 's not bad , it 's far from anything special . this scottsdale	2
i 've been to gb many times and nearly always have a good experience . they have quite a solid menu all around . i really enjoy their sw eggrolls , garlic fries , burgers , chicken pesto pasta , pizzas , and steaks . the deserts are very delicious	3
some of the dishes at pho van are so good i pretty much just <unk> them . the noodle bowls are wonderful , filled with fresh ingredients , a rich mixture of flavors and variety of textures . the food is healthy and very tasty . they have some exotic	3
this restaurant has really good quality seafood . the menu is large . the restaurant is large , romantic and has a separate bar area . it 's very pretty and classy on the inside , but not snooty , meaning you can go casual and relax . the food	3
i love this place . i 've been to numerous bars , grills , and restaurants . there is nothing i do n't love about this place . first , the food is outstanding , quality , and large portions . happy hour has 1/2 off all drinks and 1/2	4
this is a fun and funky place . any music lover would like this place . yes , it 's done in an alice cooper theme . there is a large variety of <unk> rock and roll memorabilia on the walls signed by a variety of artists . there are	4
color me impressed . given the quality of sushi restaurants in the greater valley area , i was worried about conveyor belt sushi here . i mean , if they ca n't make it right in the kitchen , how is it gon na be on a <unk> belt ?	3
i had been to the mojo on mill , however , i 'd never tired this one . it had far less flavor options than on mill , but they had not one , not two , but three flavors of mochi and a whole ton a great fresh fruit	3
we 're not big fans of chain restaurants , but the cheesecake factory is an exception . you always know you 're going to get tasty food , and a large serving -lrb- usually enough to share or take home half -rrb- . plus , they 've got a huge	3
i never thought i 'd be reviewing many chain restaurants , but this warrants a review . i 've always been pretty happy with chipotle ; you know what you 're getting . granted , the ones in co give you a free drink with a student id , and	2

i 've been trying various cheap mexican food `` stands '' in an effort to find something that resembles what you find in san diego . fiesta burrito is the best i 've found in the valley . -lrb- note : los favoritos is up there with it -rrb- i	3
this is my favorite breakfast place in the valley . i used to go to the scottsdale location more , but now i generally go to this location , because it is dog friendly ! yay ! the food is of the same consistent quality of the scottsdale restaurant .	4
unlike other reviewers , i 'm not on a <unk> basis with the <unk> . we started with the spiced nuts -lrb- great -rrb- and the rock shrimp -lrb- average -rrb- . the shrimp seemed like a well prepared version of a tgif appetizer . not particularly thoughtful or memorable	2
wow this was a pampered weekend . i would recommend going to this place just for fun . i went with my wife for a weekend of ... hmmm ... and loved it . . so different and new and fresh . staff is nice , rooms are clean ,	4
just like some others have said , the word that comes to mind is sexy ... i actually like this place a lot . very nice and fancy and not as expensive as you would think . i believe in quality and price going together but this place is surprisingly	4
i do love the cheesecake factory . you ca n't really go wrong here , pretty much every dish is gon na be good . i had the mac & cheese burger . fantastic ! just picture a juicy savory burger topped with a patty made of mac & cheese	3
my boyfriend & i decided to try this place ... and we were not disappointed . it was delicious !! cute place , clean , and everyone who worked there was super friendly . i had the miso ramen and the bf had the shoyu ramen , both were so	3

best torta in az . . i am in love with this place . i have n't even tried anything else , i love their torta 's that much .	4
nasty margarita and awful service . came in on a thursday night before a movie and it was not good . maybe it 's because we sat at the bar ? i 'm not sure , but no one wanted to help us . the house margarita was so gross	1
finally found a dish i like a <unk> . i get the honey mustard salad which is tasty . since my husband is a fan of <unk> i 'll be back .	2
yup best mexican food in the area ! the tortillas are homemade and you can taste the difference it makes . ordered the soft taco combo and it came it rice and beans . ordered the chips and salsa too . was yummy all the way around . will go	4
friendly family environment , i eat alone a lot and they let me sit and read my book and enjoy coffee before my meal . i can only speak to the breakfast items and have loved everything i have eaten here . i do love a good hollandaise sauce and	4
the staff was super helpful and friendly , the rooms were clean and cute and i loved all the pool areas . i will defiantly try a ` stay-cation ' here this summer .	4
great funky band , attentive service on the drinks , and we found a table in this crowded little blues club . i loved that the patrons where eclectic and fun and people wanted to dance and kick back . it was to loud in there either . the bathrooms	3
wifey and i dined here in <unk> , 2008 , and we found this joint to be very overpriced and very average . the place was dead on a weeknight , a bad sign . the room looked like it could hold 300 people , and there were only about	1
i know you 'll come here for the beer , but i have been to this joint twice with wifey , and the food is really good ! we 've had salads , wings , a burger , and appetizers , all items have been very tasty and fresh .	3

typical sports bar , in dire need of some <unk> ! this place looks -lrb- and smells -rrb- like <unk> , <unk> the hd tv 's . its an ok place to meet a pal for a beer , but no dates , or it 'll be your last date	2
just finished another meal here courtesy of a gift card . this place is always busy and i 've never been able to understand why . if no one ever gave me a gift card here , i would never eat here . the service varies from very good to	1

great place ! finally a great seafood place in the valley . went here for lunch monday as my wife was shopping up the street at last chance -lrb- which i call the crazy lady store -rrb- . nice ambiance and atmosphere . rock star service from bartender heather .	4

couple things i love in life , hot dogs and maui , now brought together and maui dog proves that hot dogs can have some unique flavor other than plain mustard and/or ketchup . had a beef dog with spicy <unk> and mango salsa to keep the flavors <unk> out	2

great lunch specials ! the best green tea ever ! love this place . always great fast service .	4
pita jungle is awesomeness ! the only reason i 'm giving this place three stars is because the last time i ate here my lettuce had fruit fly on it . yuck ! the gyro 's i had before the fruit fly experience were tasty .	2
i 've avoided yelping this place for a reason ; that reason is that it sucks just as badly as their other location in the hilton village . the food is horrible , the diners are mostly douches and although this location features less popped collars than the one in	0

who does n't love a good movie and a clean theater ? yep , that sums it up . i usually frequent this place during the week and i do n't have too many <unk> getting tickets . what is unfortunate is that there is one person at the customer	3
hidden gem . . scary exterior -lrb- especially if you are n't from the area -rrb- . so we found this place on yelp . . drove around a few times and then when we found it , we could n't believe this place was actually where we were thinking	3
`` vegetarian never tasted soo good '' no really , i have been continually impressed . i have been here about 3-4 times and this place has yet to disappoint . so let 's talk about some of the things i 've had : spicy buffalo `` wings '' chili	4
the taqueria is the place to go . it 's fast and pretty good . i 'm a huge fan of the veggie burrito and chipotle potatoes . both are to die for ! that being said , the rest of the menu is good , but nothing spectacular .	3
delicious new mexican cuisine ! they do n't do mild . the staff is friendly and will keep you glass full , but beware that it 's not the quickest service . this is definately a place to go and unwind and take your time eating . food - i	3
holy delicious <unk> batman !! the bean dip is fantastic , almost filled me to much for the good good at dinner . prepare to have you food smothered in delicious sauce !	3
hands down , best donuts in the valley . all the locations are great . most are open 24 - 7 and the flavor is fantastic . it 's a great pickup for a morning office meeting or an even better late night snack after a night of fun .	4
i seriously love this restaurant . it 's an awesome <unk> to kierland commons . the bar is great - bartenders are always fun . the menu is superb - i 've never had a bad meal here . i love their homemade <unk> things . they literally melt in	3

gross ! their tortilla soup tasted like vomit . after two spoons full i proceeded to throw up in the bathroom ! never eating there again !	0
i used to be a student and this place was awesome for studying and keeping caffeinated . now though , when i go there to relax , i feel like i 'm sitting in a study hall with a coffee bar in it . more power to them for catering	2
laid back , great beer , and a menu packed with variety for everyone . we sat on the outside patio and enjoyed lunch . i got the portabella veggie beer bread since i had no idea what to expect from the name alone ! turns out , it is	3
although i 've never eaten in the dining room , i am a regular at the bar , and have a great time every time ! the bartenders and cocktail waitresses are always so nice , and the band on weekends is super entertaining . i always know i can	3
cute and affordable . finally an alternative that i actually want to go to ! every time i try to break away from the corporate coffee chains , i get burned because their lattes taste like dirt , or they act like they 've never heard of soy milk .	3
once we found this place -lrb- i think we did 3 <unk> -rrb- , we were happy with what was at the end of the treasure hunt . this little coffee house is adorable . it 's got a boutique in the same space , it has a groovy selection	3

more like `` cougar ranch '' , am i right ? i have a habit of <unk> on saturday nights , but this place has what i need to keep me tipsy and entertained . started off by checking out the live music . people were being lame and just	3
this is the rowdy , <unk> version of rosie mccaffrey 's . with a small bar , and a tiny stage , it 's easily packed to the brim , with raucous customers slamming irish car bombs to the beat of an irish <unk> . nothing about the <unk> selection	2
food was good and plentiful . had breakfast burrito with green chili sauce - pretty darn good . the wait and seating is a crapshoot as some that came after got seated before us .	3
i 'm not really a big fan of getting food that has ingredients that are n't mentioned on the menu . not just my meal but my friends had food that was n't exactly what we ordered .	1
consistent food , nice family atmosphere and spicy pickles . what more could you want ?	2
excellent crust , quality ingredients , nice beer selection , and the pizza is always cooked perfectly .	3
i love zipps ! i have been going to zipps for years mainly to watch sports on one of the many televisions they have playing or for their amazing wings and happy hour . the wings are better grilled too so try them that way !	3

5 stars for the special fishes . the wild caught salmon , the ono , and a couple other atypical fish they had this past weekend . it 's been months since i 've been here -lrb- i 'm wondering why it took so long to come back -rrb- .	4
i do n't expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall , but i expect better than this . the seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment , the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy , the fish was <unk>	0
basic <unk> food done well - sounds easy but how often do i actually find that ? i do at <unk> -lrb- yes it 's one word , not too -rrb- . in the last two months since the opening i 've probably been there a dozen or more times	3
pull the car over now !!! that 's what my dear husband <unk> whenever we drive by tammie coe . the first time i tried her cakes was right before our wedding 3 years ago , and i called and begged her to do my cake and she squeezed it	3
the location and atmosphere are tops , service is fine , food is forgettable . i can say this because i ate there about a month ago , and now that i 'm getting around to doing the review i can hardly remember what we had - a rare thing	1

wow ... where has this place been all my life ? or at least since i moved to phoenix : -rrb- by far and away the best pie i 've had in the valley . at yelp 's suggestion , we tried out this joint with another couple and we	4
i really do enjoy whole foods and the only reason i do n't do my primary grocery shopping here is because of the expense . however , i frequent wf for their salad and hot bars during lunchtime . again , not cheap but the food is fresh and the	2
we had a great happy hour here . the beer was fantastic and cheap until 6 pm . our black bean burger was average and the service was ok . if we were in the area , we would probably try it again .	2
i think this location obviously has some kinks to work out but otherwise our meal here on opening day was nice . i 'm a big fan of the location in mesa and did n't like the food quite as much at this new store in phoenix . i ca	2
the pizzas we ordered were amazing ... one white pizza and one traditional with basil and tomatoes . both were perfectly cooked and brought to us by a very friendly wait staff . i will definitely come here again .	3
we frequent bj 's on girl 's nights . they have good food , a casual atmosphere and great beer . i would give it a higher rating if their prices were a little lower for the type of cuisine you get . ca n't go wrong with the crispy	2
so happy we live so close to chelsea 's kitchen ! this place is great . fresh food , reasonable prices and a nice ambiance . do n't miss the white sangria , it is refreshing and wonderful to share . the service is usually good although the last time	3
i went here to celebrate my birthday . first let me say this , the service in this place is impeccable . i 've had very few establishments serve me in such fashion and i would be surprised if an establishment could top the quality of the service in kai	3
i 'm taking a tour of old town scottsdale eateries , so i ended up here at that bungalow . my experience here was nice . i genuinely enjoyed every bite of my ahi tuna salad . i ate it all up . the service was nice . the establishment	2
once again , i 'm reminded of a place i visited and that i enjoyed , but allowed to drop off my food radar . i guess for a while i traveled so much last year that it 's not too hard to imagine i 'd forget about a few	3
michael martin murphy might have said `` it 's a long way back to new mexico '' , but in phoenix , you can take a short ride down hayden from old town scottsdale to carlsbad tavern for a great taste of new mexico . this place is really cool	2

this is a review that has been in the making for quite some time . this review is for the this location . this is a 3.5 star review , but i ca n't give them a 3 . i will cut to the chase and save most of my	3
went back again and the food and price are still good !	3
i have been here for lunch several times . try to get in the door before 12 ; 11:30 if you can . i find the service to be acceptable on most occasions , but that can slow down when the place starts packing up . that goes the same	1
a great place to enjoy a meal outside . the farm was serene and the weather was perfect . the farm monte cristo , a `` french toast sandwich '' with ham and eggs , was very tasty . the french toast was melt in your mouth and the over	3
this is a cozy coffee shop in a strip mall . i went for lunch one day and ordered a sweet crepe with nutella , strawberries , and bananas . it was very good . in addition to the sweet and savory crepes , you can also create your own	4
shady 's is the polar opposite of the kind of bars you will find in scottsdale . it 's dark . it 's small . it has no theme , no slick decor . it 's kind of like the basement of your parents ' house , complete with random	4
one of the more bizarre <unk> i have seen ... why is the place to be after work in scottsdale a restaurant in a mall `` basement '' ? is it the choice view of the parking garage entrance ? the gentle breeze laden with the scent of car exhaust	2
it is a gem . hidden ? literally perhaps . try finding a place to sit during prime hour , though . i really do like this place a lot despite the yuppie crowd . great wine selection . tasty bites . very dark . couches . cool place to	4
cold . bad music -lrb- think cheesy nightclub music aimed at the <unk> aging segment of the population -rrb- . not a good selection of food . not a good selection of wine by the glass . overall , i would say this place has an identity crisis going on	1
it had been a while since i 've been to cherry blossom , so i did n't feel good about reviewing it until i tried it again recently . it was just as good as i remembered . the service is a tad slow and it is pretty smoky inside	3
words can not describe this food . it is a true delight to dine here . authentic upscale mexican food . you will not find chips and salsa here . you will find amazing shrimp dishes , an array of freshly prepared salsas and watermelon juice . cozy , colorful	4
mickey 's rocks . open for <unk> . i have spent many nights here <unk> trying to sober up by downing sweet potato fries , sliders , and other choice hangover treats . it 's totally divey , full of <unk> couches , and people having a good old time	3
this is not good asian food . the veggie stir fry was terrible . the rice was <unk> . the hot and sour soup was very good - a bright spot on the menu . if i was ever forced to come here again , i would order that .	1
come here for new mexico style mexican cuisine . think hot hot hot . red or green . pick your poison . the rellenos are great . i have no idea what <unk> is talking about - as far as i know there is only one other los dos is	3
this is a delightful little place for a glass of wine and bite to eat after work . i finally stopped last friday and was charmed . lisa g herself poured my glass and chatted me up . i enjoyed some dessert . it was quite good . lunch is	3
my all time favorite spot . best sunset in the valley . <unk> views and decor . amazing martinis . excellent food . i do n't usually order seafood in the desert but the scallops here were amazing . when i ate here in may i saw mario <unk> leaving	4
** now open for sunday brunch ** 8 am - 3 pm this is a true neighborhood cafe with fresh food at <unk> prices . acacia cafe just opened and i could n't be happier . it is easy to miss , sandwiched between an italian restaurant and a retail	4
i shop here every weekend . even though i feel as though whole foods has lost some of its original <unk> since turning into a giant national chain it is still better than anyplace else to shop . you will always find a nice selection of organic foods and groceries	3
it 's pf changs . it 's generic americanized asian food . what else is there to say .	1
food is ok and the beer selection is pretty typical for a sports bar . the chicken `` focaccia '' sandwiches are ok . they are n't made with the traditional italian focaccia bread but rather more like a middle eastern flatbread or wrap . happy hour selections are pretty	2
been here twice and not sure if i 'll return . the first time i came here was for a massage . the second for a facial . the massage was ok , however , the facial was not . the facilities were decent with a good fitness center but	2
more like 3.5 stars this is their 2nd location with the 1st in old town scottsdale . there is n't much to the decor but it 's pretty clean and the food is consistent . while they need more hired and seasoned help the staff is friendly and do what	3
this place lives up to its reputation and i always leave <unk> . one of my favorite places to go for good subs , italian cured meats , and antipasto . while it 's setup as a mini market / deli , the market offerings are a little pricier than	3
this is going to be simple and <unk> : if you have <unk> then come here . if you do n't want to go to old town and feel old then come here . or if you do n't want to go to north scottsdale and see a lot of	1
yay ! it 's not another starbucks ! how come it took so long for a coffee shop to open in this retail center ? good coffee , friendly service , and a few treats as well . wish it was a bit bigger with more seating but i 'll	3
fun place for a few beers and live music . it 's a big space with a <unk> room in the back for some good entertainment . i 've heard mixed reviews on the food from good to meh but both times i stopped in were for the liquid meals	2
had an hour to grab lunch during a training , and we ended up here . napoli pizza was decent , and the <unk> salad was tasty , but the price was a little ridiculous for the amount of food . having a time limit was also a little tough	2
huh , so i 'm clearly in the minority with this review . after hearing about this place repeatedly , i was excited to give it a try . end result was a `` meh '' . for 6 of us , the total was $ <unk> . holy crap	2
really ? who has n't eaten at oregano 's ? consistently yummy -- the meatballs are good -lrb- better out of the sub though -rrb- , sandwiches are good , and the salads are delicious ! the vino bambino -lrb- or something close to that -rrb- was super yummy !	3
good affordable gyros	2
good service with good pricing for both dry cleaning and laundry services .	3
friendly staff long happy hour til 9pm live music , great specialty happy hr drinks and apps . plus a secret room behind the <unk> .	3
had dinner there the other day . again - i love the design and atmosphere . service was good but the food ... not worth the $ $ $ they are asking for . starting with the kids option - i ordered the pasta with marinara sauce which the server	1
food was not good ... and we were hungry ! deco is outdated . service was good . but really the food was tasteless and not appealing .	1
this place is great . the owner is very nice and friendly . the mediterranean sandwich was amazing and the omelets look fantastic . i will definitely go there again and try their breakfast sandwich .	3
probably the best sushi in town . fresh fish - always ! -lrb- not easy in az -rrb- we always enjoy the strong drinks . not much changes in the menu and the specials repeat , so i would like to see more creativity but overall i love this place	4
i was <unk> to try this place out . a new <unk> / healthy restaurant in phoenix is this girls dream come true ! first of all , i loved the decor and ambiance . put wheat grass plants in any restaurant and i love it ! i had the	4
lots of bad reviews but i like this place as i frequent it once every couple weeks . i eat sushi out about 3 days a week so i run out of places to go . i went last night . they changed their menu ! at least the looks	2
i am `` dragged '' to this place at least once every 2 weeks by my `` dining partner '' who loves their steaks . being the vegetarian that i am , i have never had one but i can find plenty on the menu to eat . -lrb- i	4
it was very quite when we went on a sunday afternoon with our groupon . ordered the ham and brie and greek salad . it was good but i am not sure good enough to make me want to seek it out again - sorry	2
we have tried various dog parks in phx and found this to be the best . the dogs are separated into active and passive and the place is always well maintained and will be shut if there has been heavy rain or anything to let the place recover . the	3
went with a groupon - probably the most disappointed i have been with one . i am not sure what i had as it did not resemble what i had ordered -lrb- i thought anyway -rrb- and it was tasteless . i just wanted to be done and really did	0
came in for desert . service was terrible . ice-cream was good , but was it better than what i can get at a diary queen - i am not so sure . nostalgic atmosphere for sure , but not a lot else going for it , sorry	2
this is an easy place to pick for lunch with my work friends . they offer a nice selection of salads where even a half order is too much for one person - like other reviewers , the caramelized peach is my favorite . artichoke and spinach dip is always	3
wow , where to begin ... very nice ambiance with glass walls to break up the interior sections . we sat in the room to the rear of the piano bar and could hear each other just fine - it was very crowded and i did see groups with kids	4
rosemary roasted nuts - sweet and nice . fondue - a little <unk> , bread was toasted a little too much but the sausage was wonderful . burrata - if you only get one thing , this should be it . short rib - presented on the bone with a	2

this place is frustrating - i 've had a pretty decent food and service but mostly both are terrible . i 've been here quite a few times , always in a pinch when i wanted to grab falafel that was close to the house ... they never seem to	1
friendly staff , great atmosphere , and adequate food . plus , cider and guiness on tap !	3
food is hit or miss . best aspects of this place are the appetizers and drinks . great atmosphere , even has an outdoor <unk> . awesome for happy hour !	3
i used to like lola until i learned the owner is a <unk> pig . i will never visit again !	0
i did n't eat the pizza , so i ca n't comment there . i sampled three dishes . my friend ordered eggplant parmesean , and that was tasty , but i 've had better . my husband and i both ordered pasta dishes . the pasta itself was ok	2
love this place ! went last night for the <unk> and it was amazing with the chihuly exhibit going on .	4
my recommendations : golden medium wings , monaco focaccia , and the half & half sides of onion rings / fries . they always run specials for happy hour and depending on the day they have specific plates on specials . you can go wrong with this sports bar .	3
favorite mexican food in phoenix , arizona hands down .	4
seems weird to order wings at an italian joint but they 're amazing !!! have never had a bad meal at oreganos !	3
my rating is actually more in the range of 3.5 . went here for a birthday dinner with friends and was really impressed by ambience and service . the server was very knowledgeable about the food -lrb- at times i felt i was listening to the chef or critics on	2
in my search for trivia nights , i visited the place this tuesday . place wasnt too crowded , not sure its the norm . the food was decent and service was ok . the place can be difficult to find in the complex . the trivia was fun ,	2
it should be no surprise that the ambience and service at this restaurant located inside a 5 star resort is impeccable . what is <unk> though is that the food is good as well . what was even better of course was that i wasnt paying for it : -rrb-	3

nice dark bar in the late afternoon for a nice little happy hour : -rrb-	3

delux , you are the <unk> of burger restaurants . i say this because of the <unk> for gay clientele to fill your swank space . also because the overwhelming desire to be trendy and coming across as trying to hard seems to fit as well . that being said	2
these are the items you should sample at ticoz : - blood orange mojito . do not dare to get another drink because it will be a mistake . - corn tamales with shrimp . mix the tamales with the shrimp and some beans on your fork . - carnitas	3

great supermarket ... has most foods that you need from around the world at really good prices	4
real thai food . great drunken noodle . prices are very reasonable . it 's not a `` fancy '' or trendy looking place , but if you 're looking for very good food at an affordable price , look no further .	3
4.5 stars ... best pizza in phoenix and probably the best tiramisu i 've ever eaten . i tried bianco , and did n't care for it . tried cibo and found it much better . however , in my opinion , this beats cibo because of the pizza crust	3
this is the 2nd best sushi in scottsdale , without being overpriced and over <unk> by $ 3 million decor , like most of the boring <unk> restaurants in snotsdale that <unk> with money to burn go to get drunk . they have japanese chefs , and they give you	4
inside the $ 200 + / night downtown phoenix hyatt hotel , this is the casual dining watering hole for the hotel where mostly out-of-town <unk> grab a bite and stiff one . it has a bar and tables with tvs inside , and a reasonable sized covered patio outside	2
i used to live in snotsdale , and this was the premiere shopping mall for that town with endless shopping choices . at least for the <unk> <unk> types who sought brand names and designer boutiques . or lived too far away from kierland commons to come down here .	3
so , we received at $ 20 off coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try . let 's just say ... it 's been some months since then and we have n't been back ... the only time this place has popped up on my radar	1
where do i begin ? this place is amazing ! i have been many times , and each time i try a new dessert and am always pleased . they have tsoynami 's -lrb- think vegan blizzard -rrb- , an assortment of <unk> pastries , <unk> beverages , and more	4
i have found my new favorite veg friendly restaurant ! first off , everything is organic and as local as possible . they do n't have any mock meats , just pure food . they have salads , wraps , soup , desserts , starters , and entrees . everything	4

ok , i 'm torn . i dig this the atmosphere , with its trendy vibe and blue lights and the super rad lamp at the end of the bar . the drinks are very tasty , and happy hour lasts until 6:30 . i usually get the red sangria	3

i 'm happy i <unk> my fear of community tables and finally made it in for dinner . turns out , not all of the tables are big 8 <unk> and maybe i can be more social . the tuck shop is the perfect small , local , friendly eatery	3
solid , adult option on mill that offers you a chance to dine among the younger set without feeling like a dirty old man or woman ... but , do n't stare too long , because you can still cross the line if you do n't check your <unk> <unk>	3
above average decor , but only average burger and fries . i went here for lunch and while having a beer and watching the tvs over the bar seemed like a great idea , that was not to be on this day . -lrb- they have a good cocktail list	2

expensive and just ok .	1
sat at the sushi bar ; it was like sitting at a table alone , you ca n't see the fish to determine freshness , etc. , what i usually do at a sushi bar . this is a very pricey place for what you get , the nigiri are	1

los dos is many an arizona native 's favorite mexican food place . and it has the -lrb- <unk> -rrb- reputation for the spiciest food around ! they also have a hoppin ' cantina . there is a lot of <unk> and triumph behind the los dos molinos franchise .	4

they have everything	4
really great pizza without the hype . do it .	3
standard dive bar . nothing extraordinary so if you 're not already close by , do n't bother .	2
super cool place with an amazing bottled beer selection . if they had that same selection on tap they 'd earn 11 stars .	3
this place could be super cool , if only they knew how to make coffee . the location is great , the layout is super fun and the music selection was fantastic . unfortunately the coffee was mediocre at best so i will not be returning .	2
the beer on tap is amazing . but i always feel like i 'm walking into a private room and it 's difficult to get a seat .	3

i go for the <unk> and the fries thats about it . my friend is a vegan and she tell me to try the best stuff on the menu . so far i had one sandwich with fake chicken with bbq that was pretty good . however , everything else	2

i have n't been to many yogurt places in town . use to love going to <unk> when i was a kid and it seems like the one in town near via linda just is n't the same . i 've tried the local favorite ice tango in hilton village	3
people that are rating this place low are nuts . it 's a greasy spoon sure , and yes , sometimes as you 'd expect from such the service leaves something to be desired . that being said this is a super tasty burger . very moist and delicious .	3
if you 're a dude , stay away from this place ... unless you 're in the mood for a cat fight , you can see some of those here for sure . i 've only ever been here with girlfriends , the guys section is only awesome if you	1

so i came here last night for a first date and was pleasantly surprised . we hit up the bar so i could check out all the local art under the glass . it was a cute touch , i love when restaurants play up the neighborhood 's culture .	3

bj 's is ok on occasion . my husband loves the mostly <unk> , <unk> pan pizza . me , not so much . however , the atmosphere seems fun -lrb- kind of loud , but that <unk> out our usual loud talking -rrb- . there are <unk> tvs throughout	2

during my few trips to phoenix -lrb- particularly the scottsdale area -rrb- i always find myself thinking that it reminds me a lot of boca <unk> , florida -lrb- where i grew up -rrb- , but with mountains . and personally i think the mountains make phoenix so much cooler	3
i 'm going to try and not <unk> it here . i love steve 's espresso . maybe there are fancier coffee shops out there . i 'm not going to say this is the best coffee shop in the world . but it * is * the best one	4
i really like pei wei . but you have to understand what it is . it is a chain . it is not quite fast food , but not quite a restaurant . it is rarely great , but almost never bad . it 's consistent , like most chains	2
i was torn on my rating here . the food is 4 star easy , the overall experience is slightly less - i 'd love to give it 3.5 . but the food was just that good , so i 'd rather round up than down . if you did	3
i 've been here a few times and could n't resist the temptation when i saw a yelp deal for phoenicia . i 'm a huge fan of this style of food and they do everything very well here . the two times i have come here my gf and	3
for the price , the wine is n't bad . they advertise it being a local winery but i think it mostly come from new mexico . if you want decent az wine check out the selection at wf or aj 's . they have some that are much better	1
i have lived here for nearly 10 years . i acquired my sushi addiction back in <unk> and am always in search of some good quality fish . most places in az are a dime a dozen . nothing special , completely average and nothing to separate one from another	4
i 'm going to write this place off as just one of those things in which mesa patrons are just not capable of giving accurate info when it comes to sushi . our experience ? pretty terrible . i have a few standbys i get everywhere to compare . one	1

first things first ... i love meat ! i will never become a vegan or a vegetarian . but i am not going to turn my nose to a restaurant that serves vegan/vegetarian options only . i loved the cool ambiance that green offers . the staff is super friendly	3

good things first : fresh baked bread from <unk> 's bakery is fluffy and delicious . lux coffee means local support and a good taste -lrb- barista style coffee -rrb- organic ingredients -lrb- as far as i know -rrb- for most of their produce original recipes for dressings and such	3

i 'm so conflicted here , that i will just add the pros and cons and land in the middle with my rating . uncle sam 's has what is arguably the cheapest happy hour drinks in all the valley . beer is a buck a pint and a half	2
this is just overall a great place ! it 's tough to do this review , as i can probably only remember 1/2 of my times being here , and that is being generous . there 's something about the atmosphere here that just makes you want to tie one	3
i am very impressed with this place . the unique decor and inside / outside set up of tables was a nice change from the ordinary . this place feels like a cottage -- very homey . for lunch on a saturday , the place was packed -- i think	4
my favorite upscale sushi in scottsdale . the w hotel is beautiful and roku is no different . the vibe is upbeat with trendy music playing in the background . everyone in the restaurant is sexy and dressed to impress . great date place or <unk> place in walking distance	4
nice , hip secret locale for gourmet sandwiches and good beer choices . the place always feels a little dirty -- which i think is their intent . this is a nice little place if you want to grab a quick bite to eat and a drink before an event	3
burgers are phenomenal ... order one with `` half and half '' and get a generous portion of fries and onion rings . my favorite sports bar in old town .	3
check out geisha any time sunday for great specials on food and alcohol ... good vibe ... pretty people and dj type music on . great place to roll into in shorts or dressed up . many different types of sake make this place stand out .	3

if location were the only criteria , jade palace would get 10 stars . conveniently located next to sweet republic , jade palace offers the perfect opportunity to suggest chinese for dinner , knowing you 'll end up with heaven for dessert . probably 3.5 stars , but feeling generous	3
while i appreciate a good steak occasionally , i do n't appreciate $ 9 baked potatoes . i 'm sorry , but if i 'm paying $ 40 for a piece of meat , is it too much to ask to throw in the potato ? this <unk> has eliminated	3
well i guess i 'm going to be in the minority here and say that i was somewhat disappointed . not too much , but a little . it is ridiculously inexpensive , and for the money , i thought the food was decent . we started with the <unk>	2

when i first moved to arizona in the late 1990 's , the valley 's foodie community was even smaller , and there were fewer websites to help us discover new places . that was when the bamboo club was my little secret . i would take many dates up	3
it 's a pretty good quick service version of the valley 's best mediterranean restaurant . this pita jungle has a drastically reduced menu that is perfectly suited for fashion square 's food court . it 's also probably one of the healthiest food choices in the mall . i	3
nothing superb , but certainly nothing bland . z ` tejas is a quality tex-mex chain that rarely disappoints . it has that bar vibe , but certainly not the scottsdale vibe that most of the restaurants in fashion square seem to be going for . my girlfriend and i	2

many people have recommended that i try eating at the keg , but the thought of yet another upscale chain steakhouse was kind of a <unk> . the food is usually great at places like this , but the lack of uniqueness is a bit a of put off .	3
if you have n't shopped at a fresh and easy , the simple way to describe the store is it 's like trader joe 's . only fresh and easy has a modern feel to it instead of the hippie co-op atmosphere . for being a relatively small store ,	3

great little `` greasy spoon '' breakfast diner . usually packed if you get there to late in the morning though , especially weekends . great omelettes and super service !	3
good authentic thai food . their menu is n't as extensive as thai elephant , but their prices are cheaper , and they are much closer to my house ! great place to grab some takeout , or bring a friend and eat in . good spring rolls , and	3
rip <unk> 's , just as well , big earl 's is much better ... they have some fantastic happy hour specials . my favorite so far : $ 5 crawfish boil on fridays . it is about 1 lb of mud bugs , which is an excellent snack .	3
here is my -lrb- probably not unique -rrb- take on pizzeria bianco : do n't come here on a budget , order away , and leave satisfied . do n't expect to walk right in , unless you plan ahead -lrb- get there at 4pm -rrb- , * and *	4

this is an old classic . it 's neat enough inside to go just for the hell of it . it 's like an antique or a museum piece . the drink prices are from a different era as well . if you can grab a good spot , you	2
i 've been to this place numerous times over the years and most recently last night . they 've done a bit of remodeling and raised the prices , but i 'm afraid the quality has gone down . where 's the quality control ? they got my steak wrong	2
bar smith = worst bar ever i wrote that on my cocktail napkin after being in this place for only 10 minutes . let 's just say it was n't worth battling all the <unk> streets and construction paying the $ 5 cover -lrb- i see many people complaining about	1
<unk> . came here for a monday night movie and the best part was that it was empty . the bad part was the women 's bathrooms were disgusting ! why were there a bunch of people on staff and hardly any customers , but still dirty bathrooms ? also	1
sushi , you are such a cruel <unk> ! so delicate , so <unk> prepared , such a sweet and pleasant sensation to my taste buds ; yet so pricey ! sakana is a great <unk> when in the running next to tokyo lobby . sakana carries fig vodka ,	4
best place for chicken breast ! always looks good , never suspect ! though i will walk around aimlessly , chicken is really all that i 'll buy from them .	4
amazing short rib tacos . will be back soon .	4
oh st. francis how i love thee let me count the ways is it your beauty ? is it your charms ? is it your fine , fine cuisine ? nay ! it is all !	4
go here ! great value and amazing food ! does n't look like much from the outside - but give it a chance and come on in ! fantastic lunch specials - pad thai is out of this world !! the curry is also not to be missed . service	4
trader joe 's , you complete me ! i 'm a very loyal customer ! everything i could ever want or need under one roof for great prices ! for such quality items i would expect to pay quite a bit - but trader joe 's is the true exception	4
amazing !! lunch special was very reasonable and the food was great !! maybe one of the best pad thai i have ever had . the chicken curry is very good to very thick great flavor !!	4
food is outstanding and portion sizes are large .	4
came here the other day and had the worst service ever . the food was still amazing .	2
food is always great . i love the meatloaf sandwich . the service is really hit or miss . sometimes i have great servers who are passionate about their work . other times service is just ok . the ground is always super slick and sticky and it really takes	3
price + quality = amazing i love how they use a <unk> to slice meats there . the bread is amazing chewy how a sandwich should be . i want one right now . the italian dressing homemade is amazing ask for it .	4
great service . food was good bar food nice atmosphere . great place to chill and have a beer .	3
i just got back from lunch here with a co worker , and yes i am writing this instead of working , but come on its friday . from the external appearance i was unsure as it is not in a bright , shiny and new building , the interior	3
more than just pho ` you sit at long almost communal tables with just a small gap separating you from your neighbor . prices are low but the portion sizes match that so order a few things . there is a great veggie selection , spring rolls noodle dishes even	3
i just stopped in tonight after the gym , i was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap . it was late 8:15 when i walked in <unk> before close . this is a great time to shop when you are in	4
pros : great bread , great fresh mozzarella cheese cons : price , lack of indoor seating , lack of fountain drinks i come here for one thing and one thing only mozzarella cheese , the fire baked bread is a plus . every sandwich comes with very chewy caramel	3
start off your trip here just like the cows did , <unk> in to a long <unk> line , but you will be met by some one who takes your order not the <unk> house . if you are not a meat eater your options are limited , and on	3
i guess the lucky cat was watching over my meal because was good . i recommend you <unk> yourself with the menu when you first go in as there are many tempting options . they have typical chinese <unk> dish foods and a beautiful array vegetables for their build your	3
i showed up to this little place today with my co-worker . i was wearing business clothes , pressed wool pants ' long <unk> shirt etc. . i did not fit in or match the decor , but that did not matter . i read over the menu atop their	4
valet parking for groceries and a sandwich ? i do n't get it . i finally visited this place for lunch with some co workers . first parking was a real issue and i hate having to valet my car . once we were inside there was a very long	1
do n't be fooled by the 1950 's dancing `` girls '' with bikinis on the tv , as some are girls and some are not . this makes for a fun drinking game , but also for some awkward moments . the parking lot is small , the location	2
why would you name a restaurant after a thing designed to keep people out ? just like china this place is huge inside , and even has tanks of live fish . the menu is huge , and this is just the menu for the gringos . if you know	3
between bread or on top of lettuce , is the main choice you will make here as the vast majority of the foods are either salads , sandwiches or a few pasta options . i suggested we visit this hidden place for a team lunch one friday . the weather	3
i am still a big fan , another good rice bowl , and a po-boy this time . it was the <unk> time i ever ventured to the sandwich side of the menu <unk> i was pleased . we had a <unk> po boy which was basically mock steak peppers	3
even half off the value was just terrible and i left hungry . i have been here several times with a friend who works for the parent corporation and gets 1/2 off our bill . with the discount i felt i could try a bit more and started my meal	1
live near campus ? do n't have a back yard ? like to drink ? than casey moores might be right for you . the patio is the main attraction for me . it is like the back yard that i want but am too lazy and cheap to have	3
i came for the pasta and maybe should have had the pizza . i was looking for something different my family would try , and this place fit that bill . inside you will find real tablecloths on smallish tables . we started our meal with a fried zucchini $	2
a gastro pub is still a pub , sandwiches , pizza and fired food . maybe there is a bit of flair to make it `` gastro '' however the end result is the same . come for the brewing part and order food when you get hungry . the	3
coffee , crepes and cool hipsters , you can have a taste of all there with just one stop here . inside of a old house is jobot , prices are decent service is quick and nice and the crepe did not skimp on the basil . prices are like	3
beep beep , goes the silent death that is the light <unk> as i try to cross the street to daves electric . i <unk> in here to give it a try and have a pre a mountain hike beer , yes beer and night hiking is a decent mix	2
i have only been here twice and just to try their craft beers . so far i am impressed . my last visit i had the `` winter warner '' a spiced strong brown ale that came with some spiced ginger snap cookies that were a great pairing . i	2
water ! make sure you try a glass of water here . no , really try it , it is the best tasting water i have ever had . it must be the <unk> water they use to make the beer and the price is right . free water aside	3
you would be crazy to come here for the caprese . i liked the idea of this place but the execution along with the prices doused my enthusiasm . nearly $ 8 for a caprese is acceptable if its amazing , but here it was a salad form , cubes	1
their food is so good they need metal bars to protect it . seriously the order and pick up windows are behind bars , but it may be due to the neighborhood . this is a place the yelp is good for . there is no way you will find	2
for far to long i put this place at the rock bottom of my brewery list in town , it seems that i was mistaken . many years had passed since my last visit here , and after an invite from some friends and a good tasting at the last	3
pretty good `` american sushi '' and cheap happy hour drinks . i would never pay full price for this sushi though .	2
my boyfriend buys me one at least once a month . . sometimes we even get them at the farmer 's market in scottsdale . i have had the : orange , lavender , root beer and salted caramel flavors . salted caramel or lavender . . ca n't decide	4
- they off gluten-free breads and can do most items gluten-free here if you ask , even without the `` gf '' sign on the menu - they are a little pricey ... probably because the grass-fed beef , local produce and organic offerings ... - i really enjoyed my	3
i love visiting d & d . this place is about the atmosphere as well as the food . on the weekdays the place is bustling with corporate america , moms meeting up and exchanging baby stories , a few <unk> <unk> on a project and one or two snooty	4
there is always an interesting assortment of people in this place . perhaps being close to camelback and sort of close to central it attracts a varied crowd . everything from yoga <unk> to military to <unk> to <unk> . it is fun to people watch here . i 'm	3
love rogue for their ever changing list of great live music . the staff and owner are always friendly and the atmosphere is <unk> . so leave your <unk> outfit at home scottsdale . parking can be a pain , do n't block a house 's driveway , they will	3
been here twice - once for lunch , once for dinner . mellow is a bad name considering the location is where the old z - gallery was on mill - warehouse style , exposed brick and tall ceilings , very bright lighting and slick <unk> flooring . not a	1
holy sunday brunch batman ! i 've reviewed santan before for the regular saturday night , <unk> type of evening and it is indeed great . but look out saturday night , here comes sunday ! their mimosa 's are made with their <unk> - great ! their mojitos are	3
currently this location is closed -lrb- mill avenue -rrb- due to the fire damage - still waiting <unk> for them to open up again , but there are other locations too and the food is about the same . i always stick with a basic gyro and greek side salad	2
great <unk> home option for <unk> phoenix area . sat on the outside <unk> drinking cheap beer to watch the cars , pedestrians go by . best part , the hipster crowd had n't seem to take it over yet , so it still feels like a bar for the	2
i have only been here for lunch and would probably try it for a happy hour if their food was a bit more appetizing . for lunch i usually get a half sandwich -lrb- which is actually huge since one slice of bread is the size of a <unk> book	1

i tip my hat to the runners who showed up for the 2008 rock 'n' roll marathon and 1/2 marathon . not only are they good runners , but evidently they are good drivers as well . when <unk> people converge on a four block radius and all you get	2
let me start of by stating that katie was our server , and she is destined for so much more . i cant say enough about her attention to customer service . bravo ! they have good lunch specials , and great summer specials : * sunday : all day	3
for latitude eight , passion is in the presentation . their spicy thai lettuce wraps arrived <unk> , with each of the four lettuce cups containing its minced goodness and a different garnish . it was a delightful presentation . the green tea is tasty , but it is sweetened	2
my rating is based on this first review ... not on the second . on my first visit to z tejas , i went at lunchtime with 2 guys from <unk> . we had to sit at the bar since the restaurant was so crowded . as i scanned the	3
the first thing i noticed was its nice patio area . the second thing was its <unk> order process . i completely agree with gabi m , as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us , and for	1
still impressed by their avocado egg rolls , and the accompanying dipping sauce -lrb- cilantro , honey , lime , garlic , etc -rrb- was tap dancing all over my taste buds . i 'd love to have my wife replicate that so we can test out what other foods	3
great place to see a show , with the following <unk> : - ` traditional ' concerts are best - if it 's a show where you want to jump around , dance , etc. you 're kind of limited to the space around your seat , and there is	3
the patio is great . they have a tasty house red . the service was excellent . that 's the good ... i had the pesto pasta with chicken . my girlfriend had the chicken parm . it seems it would be difficult to strip flavor from italian food but	2

ohhh baby the horchata is simply amazing . 5th star well deserved . i felt like a little kid <unk> the pecans and strawberries with a spoon at the end .	4
i would have given another star if they had n't run out of horchata . to say that my heart was broken is an understatement when i was told the news . the endless supply of chips and variety of salsas did occupy my thoughts . yet , while my	3
if you go here , get a gift card from restaurant.com . they always have specials so you get 50 % <unk> % off the cards . it ends up <unk> you $ 3 when you get a $ 25 gift card to this place . so worth it .	3
this is where i come to get some good old korean food . i have tried their tofu soups and their <unk> <unk> -lrb- i do n't know how to spell this -rrb- . their tofu soup is offered with a variety of meats , kimchi , <unk> , and	3

had the bulkogi mini plate . very cheap at $ 5 , but it 's not really bulkogi - more like a thin steak with very sweet barbecue sauce - and the rice was too sticky . the lone bright spot of the meal was probably the <unk> salad .	1
salad and bread delicious . entrees just ok .	2
jade bar has been a <unk> pad for several nights out , including a couple of new year 's <unk> and at least one anniversary celebration . the view always breathtaking , regardless of the time of day or the weather . on this particular visit , i wondered if	4

i went to bosa yesterday and to be honest , i am pretty dam torn . i believe i do like krispy kremes yeast doughnuts better though . bosa 's yeast doughnuts although <unk> and larger , are simply not as light and airy as krispy kremes yeast doughnuts .	3
by far one of my favorite bbq joints in az ! i love me some bbq but am also all about the sides . if i go to a bbq place that has terrible sides , no matter how good the meat is , i most likely will not return	3
i was afraid that maybe this place wouldnt be that great but i actually really liked it . i booked a table for a bachelorette party i was hosting . never having gone here , i was not sure what to expect and if this would be a great place	3
a no <unk> eatery ... you get your greek on and feel great afterwards . my usual is the traditional , nothing special but always delicious . i almost always get things to go as the place is normally sweltering hot , decorated with crazy random and old posters of	4
so this is my local coffee shop . there 's something about this place , leaving the busy street outside to the absolutely chill vibe of echo ... maybe its just the thought that i 'm about to enjoy some primo coffee . when i read rachel 's review of	3
went on a thursday for hh and pre-game before a comedy show down the street . place was hoppin , and rightfully so . the ambiance is lively yet casual and laid back . folks were trendy , boys in their new bright <unk> shirts <unk> a sake bomb ,	3

me and my wife loved it ! went for cinco de mayo and had great drinks and food ? sat at the bar and had great service ! we will be coming back !!	4
great place ! everything we have here is great as we always find a reason to come back ! try the ahi tune ! it 's not on the menu , but they will make it for you . it 's awesome !	4
first visit recently and i thought highly of it ... pro 's - value . for the lunch price and what you get , it 's a great value !! -lrb- that 's what earned the 5th star -rrb- - quality of food i felt was very good . had	4
been coming here for 15 years ... pro 's - variety on bowl options many - quality of produce good - staff friendly and helpful con 's - maybe a tad over priced by $ 1 or so . never liked the new smaller metal bowls . will continue visiting	3
consistently good . pro 's - many soup options and all consistently <unk> - salad options good as well - staff have been there over time , friendly con 's - would like red bell pepper from time to time - cookies on desert bar would be great good place	3

`` how will short leash be able to translate all the good things about their food truck into a sit down restaurant ? '' was my only question when i ventured over to roosevelt row last week . imagine my surprise when i had all of my expectations topped .	4
this place has a cool , retro chic thing going for it as far the interior is concerned but all the <unk> ends there . first off , the entrance is kind of awkward . as soon as you walk into the `` bistro '' you are in the middle	0
i finally tried this place and honestly it tastes like other good gelato shops . the hassle of the parking lot and rude drivers just gives me anxiety . i 'd rather not get stressed out before i try to enjoy dessert . the next time i eat at la	2
what else is there to say ? this place is amazing . great wine . yummy food . excellent staff . beautiful neighborhood . <unk> interior . i love the garage door indoor/outdoor seating . i could waste my entire paycheck here . better yet ; i can move in	4
i love breakfast here ! hands down the best breakfast i have ever had -lrb- sorry mom -rrb- . they have all the basics plus you can build your own scrambles , omelets , etc. . i love their vegetarian style scrambles . the portions are so large that you	4

i must admit , i 'm a massive fan of postino arcadia and phx ... years ago , when i heard they were building a -lrb- cue dramatic and skeptical voice -rrb- <unk> location i turned up my nose . fast forward a few years , i own a house	4
there are two types of people ; those who can get past lackluster service , and those who ca n't . 5-stars for those who can , and 1-star for those who ca n't . i must <unk> the average , and therefore award 3 stars . this last weekend	2
despite the mixed reviews , i had to give this place a try since it 's nearby and has the unique setting of being underground . people are right when they say you can smell seafood as soon as you enter , but it kind of added to the ambiance	3
besides the girl at the counter being friendly , this is as bad as it gets . fake flavor , sickly sweet and runny , no substance yogurt . as a bonus , you 'll enjoy the pretentious ambiance with loud , irritating music . all the positive reviews must	0
the 2 star rating is indicative of the pizza only , and since this is a pizza joint , i think that is appropriate . there 's no reason to discuss `` authentic neapolitan '' blah , blah , blah . when something is bland , it 's not memorable	1
my first 3 star review . i usually only review a place that is exceptional or poor , but since the choices for good chinese food are so <unk> in the valley , one has to make concessions . i 've been here twice , the first time being told	2

i went to blanco on a thursday night for happy hour . we arrived right around 4:30 and were seated immediately . our table was right between the dining room and the patio , so we were able to take advantage of the beautiful breeze without having to sit outside	3

one of my biggest disappointments in having to abandon gluten has been missing out on the unbelievable sandwiches from sacks . grilled chicken , freshly sliced ham , chunks of turkey ... whatever you want , they 've got it ! <unk> wheat , rye , sourdough or spinach wrap	4

this is the new thai basil location at park central mall . i am happy to report it is much like its tempe location in food quality . i had the thai basil and it was just as delicious as the tempe location . i went during the lunch rush	3

this place is pretty cool . right off mill ave and open till 3 am . i love the inside it has a cool little vibe and a back door that goes right out to the patio of fat tuesday , cantina , handlebar etc. .	3
smash was good the first few times but this location is lacking . my first bad experience here was when i called in to place an order and the guy taking my order gave me a real hard time . i asked for a smash burger with cheese no ketchup	0
nothing wrong with this place . good food -lrb- not great but darn tasty -rrb- and service is always good -lrb- not great except on occasion . -rrb- my kids and i like to eat here in the afternoons -lrb- close to their school -rrb- because the appetizers are half-price	3
ate there with my kids <unk> . gon na go with 3.75 stars overall , rounded up to 4 . service was good , prompt , polite , and efficient , and the place was clean and tidy . 4.5 stars for those items . we had : side caesar	3
this place <unk> . cheap <unk> pita bread , and the cashiers are very cute . excellent for this type of food .	3
following up on the recent review by another yelper : this is not a `` fast food sit-down '' experience . food is cooked when you order , by a small but caring staff , and the dishes come out when they are ready . nothing is going to sit	4
have to add my fine regards to this little truck . i had the `` devil dog '' and it was indeed fairly spicy . and i 'm the guy in my group who loves it `` so hot my face sweats '' so when i say something is fairly	3
i 'm gon na have to side with the 4 + star folks on this one . there really just * is * something about the pizza that makes it tasty . i could n't identify what it was , but it just tastes good , and that 's what	3
short and sweet : staff was very friendly . phoenix burger - fairly decent bar burger . nothing to write home about . coleslaw - inedible . i do n't know what their seasoning of choice is , but it was gross . steak fries - pretty decent version .	1
great place to spend a hot hot phoenix day ... and as always , such a scene ... this is a gigantic place with absolutely beautiful stores . we went on a <unk> degree sunday so we knew it would be busy but since it is so big , the	4

i will be honest , i think your best bet with this place would be to go for happy hour -lrb- $ 5 wine , $ 5 appetizers -rrb- or on a date where someone else is paying . really really amazing food but i just got home and am	2
this is the 2nd movie theater i have been to since moving to arizona . i thought it was fine and just like any other movie theater i have been to that is connected to a mall . yes , there were several shady characters <unk> around after we got	3

avocado pizza was decent . the shop next store is very cute and a nice way to pass time while you wait for a table . or if you go for breakfast its a nice way to pass a few mins . i was disappointed the last time i was	3
3.5 stars howie burger was good but nothing earth <unk> . i had great service and the ambience is nice . nothing over the top though or that i would say you must visit while you are in phx .	2
always love coming to this location . good service . great pizza . i 'm crust lover and everything i 've tried is great . i 'm definitely a fan of the sausage there . i 'm quite the pizza lover and there are a lot of let downs in	4
good oj . good pizza sample . the cafeteria style is kinda cool but usually it can be so busy that its frustrating ! the bacon is very thick which is a great change compared to all the greasy spoon breakfast joints . the oatmeal is good and hugely <unk>	4
very cool secret sunday ! 4 free drinks -lrb- wine or mojito -rrb- , bruschetta , salad , pizza and olives ! friend them on facebook for a chance too be on their first list !	4
portlands , <unk> . maybe we caught you on a bad night . the pizza which is usually wonderful was a bit burned on the edge . we had already waited a while after placing the order so i did n't bother sending it back . but what really urged	2
always crowded on <unk> , always hard to find a place to park , always a good pour on guinness , always friendly help , always loud inside , always a good enough time . i actually prefer seamus ' downtown , but rosie 's is good enough .	2
in addition to the nice atmosphere on the patio they serve a very nice brunch menu and the $ 2 bloody marys are a buy . downside : parking validation is only a discount , not a <unk> . depending on when you go the service can be slow .	2
hmm , did n't expect to like it very much , but actually ... it 's not bad . happy hour runs from 3 to 7 every night and means almost everything on the menu is half-price . i enjoyed a decent vodka martini and shared a charcuterie board with	3
the location , atmosphere , and overall vibe is just right . it 's like being in a moderately stylish , <unk> friends house . i had the chorizo dates as an appetizer . delightful ! these alone are enough to pull me back anytime i 'm in town .	3
it 's <unk> . i knew by the way the <unk> were <unk> that this would be a <unk> sort of place , and i was n't disappointed . what i liked about it : the dj was loud as hell but isolated to the front lounge section . if	3
yes , just about every <unk> bar -lrb- meaning one that 's not part of a hotel or something -rrb- tries to claim <unk> status by littering their walls with <unk> tv 's and <unk> each to some different game . well ... see ... anyone can do that ,	4
yes , this is worth making a trip for . the happy hour menu is inexpensive and innovative -lrb- try out the asian nachos -rrb- , the sushi has been fresh on every visit , and some of the combos on the <unk> underground menu -lrb- ok maybe not so	3

dumpy dive bar with <unk> bar prices . wtf ? scary location & parking , broken glass everywhere , homeless guy out front begging for spare change , graffiti in bathrooms , etc. . beer selection nothing to get excited about either .	1
generous , tasty portions of rather healthy cuisine are just what this part of the valley needs . a nice assortment of hummus flavors are available -lrb- cilantro is a real treat -rrb- , along with numerous mediterranean favorites . i 'm rather simple so i went for the falafel	3

good atmosphere , average food , but a lot to worry about as far as menu & other policies is concerned . food is consistent , bread is above average , and prices are within normal range for phoenix . why are the traditional appetizers available only on saturday and	1
good food , good service and good atmosphere ... just tastes like <unk> food , so could n't give a 5th star .	3
excellent happy hour <unk> , great food , cool patio setting next to the bar and the private rooms downstairs are great for business meetings . this would be a 5 * , but the parking is n't very easy to deal with . highly recommended though !	3

the non-fat mocha i had was just <unk> ' t taste the <unk> . a lot of people pass through making it good for people watching , but tables are too close together to be comfortable .	2
i 've tried practically everything on this menu , and it 's a solid restaurant . nothing fancy , not too expensive , just good food . however , the service is slow and the tap water is terrible . i particularly recommend : the <unk> tofu the tempura shrimp	2

hipster central . i think the <unk> of limitations has passed so i can confess that i once got drunk with some of these hipsters and * may * of taken home one of the ubiquitous <unk> littering the place . i enjoy the <unk> where they have adult disneyland	3

finally finally went after all these years and all the hype . met some friends for happy hour . the pros : cheap beer . beer is 2 for 1 , which amounts to 2.50 cents per <unk> . having said that , ate off the happy hour menu .	1
one of the best kept cheap beer places . during happy hour , decent suds are 2.50 a pint . delicious and economical ! the patio is a great hang out spot . the interior is hard if you are group . mostly two tops . food is pretty solid	3

finally able to try windsor after hearing about it for ages . this place apparently is the new hip place to be seen at it . it is almost directly across the street from arcadia central . the same folks that frequent that spot probably run across the street to	2
come hungry . the plates are big and full of tasty goodness . i like to share with friends if possible . the food is spicy but not so spicy that i find it overwhelming . most items comes drizzled with a bit of crema which makes me happy .	3
great lunch buffet , for the price , you get a ton of different types of food to try . the naan is great and piping hot . i will say that their chicken <unk> masala is not my favorite but overall for the ambiance , this place is super	3
the parking is horrific . -lrb- it 's in the same structure as luci 's and a cupcake store -rrb- . however , brave the parking situation since this is a much needed local non-chain addition to the neighborhood . without <unk> zipps across the street , -lrb- i mean	3

what 's not to love about trader joe 's ? everyone who works there is really pleasant and their produce and other items are great and reasonably priced . their salad mixes are awesome and are what i 'm currently hooked on .	4
this place is a bit oddly located in an otherwise residential neighborhood . the patio here is awesome and a great place to go for dinner at dusk . while you 're waiting cozy up to the bar where one of the friendly bartenders will serve you up an expertly	3

probably not my first choice of places to hit -lrb- i live fairly close and can probably count on one hand the number of times i 've been here -rrb- . the place tends to get a little too crowded for my taste and if you 're not there for	2

i 'm really happy that this place moved in to what was oakville grocery . they still have the coffee bar so that makes me a happy camper . they also still have the coolers with pre-packaged food and drinks . they now have a <unk> set-up in the center	3

good mexican food , but not great . we got there just in time to take advantage of the .99 margarita 's , but the food was n't anything super special . the salsa was knock your socks off hot , which kind of <unk> your tastebuds to other flavors	2
nice little lunch buffet at a fair price . they had a fantastic chick pea salad and i really liked the <unk> chicken and rice pudding . i even got a $ 5.00 off coupon on their website , which made it a very economical lunch choice .	3

not a bad place for happy hour -lrb- 3-6 pm -rrb- , you can get their flatbreads for half off . service was friendly and efficient . my only wish is that that food selection for happy hour would be a bit larger . i know maggiano 's is known	3
the good egg , while a no-frills diner - needs to understand a simple notion about food service . not all sauces are created equal ! a perfect example is the description of the eggs benedict on the menu ... which ends saying '' topped with hollandaise sauce '' anybody	2
my only wish was that fnb was a little closer . otherwise , i really can not fault the restaurant for anything . the portions are manageable , the prices are right , and the flavors are outstanding . the staff truly has a knack for making you feel welcome	3

never in a million years did i think irish food would be tasty . i hate boiled meat and veggies , i hate soggy fish and chips . this place actually has really great food . everything was perfect . the beer was great . i normally hate corned beef	4
sigh . i do n't know , but it was lacking . maybe it was that in most greek restaurants i 've been to there is an incredible sense of family . the atmosphere is usually jovial , and inevitably there is are some greek men in a corner talking	2

aside from being a $ date spot -lrb- that 's `` money '' like how <unk> in <unk> would say it , not like `` expensive '' -rrb- , they have an excellent wine selection and great service . it 's picked up steam the past couple years and has	3
to people that have never been there , i describe at as a `` dive . '' the truth is , it 's as much a dive as a place can be in old town scottsdale , but you 're still in old town and the `` <unk> '' element	3
if you can navigate your way through the thirty page menu , you 'll find that they actually have some great offerings at the cheesecake factory . portions are huge , usually <unk> to atleast two or three meals for yours truly , so taking that into consideration the prices	3

there are so many outstanding az mex , tex mex , and new mex mex restaurants in phoenix . this just is n't one of them . everything here feels generic and mass produced , buffet or cafeteria style . which is a shame , really , as the location	2
while ajo al 's easily holds the crown for most bearable tex-mex food in town , imho , i still am a far cry from a big fan of here . one of my best friends loves this place . loves it . and i could never figure out why	2
first off , let 's clear the air . do n't judge this el bravo by the el bravo at the airport . though i 'm pretty sure they are related , they are n't working with the same facilities down there at sky harbor . for the real thing	4
what i like about martini ranch is that when you get inside -lrb- if you get inside -rrb- , you have some options . you can watch live music , shoot pool , sit outside , and dance in a club setting without leaving the premises . it is divided	3
bust out your <unk> <unk> and <unk> sacks for this one-of-a-kind sandwich `` joint '' -lrb- pun totally intended -rrb- in tempe . wow , that was a <unk> opener . anyhow , this place is driven by its `` green '' theme and everything that the restaurant serves is	3
this is the scottsdale houston 's -- the top notch of the bunch -- and it easily surpasses the already impressive service and presentation of the esplanade houston 's hands down . unfortunately , you know the <unk> thing ? it applies in this case , as well , and	3
the chuck box is one of the best burgers you will find in the phoenix metro . the style is kick back , with wood chips on the floor and a pick-up counter , so you can never feel `` too <unk> '' to go to the chuck box .	3
i like sierra bonita because it 's something different . they present a new take on what is typically cheese drenched , heavy mexican food in phoenix 's north central corridor for a healthier , more upscale version . good for a date or , even better , the perfect	3
not bad in a pinch , but only in a pinch . i find mimi 's to be a bit ... boring . the food really is n't bad or good , and the service is equally non-descript . pretty inexpensive during lunch , so it has that going for	2
three words : killer happy hour . if it were n't for that , it 'd be another run of the mill seafood place , lost in the mix between steamer 's and red lobster . the bar is cool and may serve as a breath of fresh air for	3

a local favorite sushi place of mine . as are all their locations . nothing can beat their happy hour and the red lights hanging from the ceiling give it a dark cozy atmosphere . i would recommend the mango margarita off the happy hour menu as a good choice	3

the herb box is one of my favorite restaurants in scottsdale . the decor is nice and calming and so well applied . the location on the scottsdale canal is really nice and there 's a large patio that takes advantage of this . the menu has so many different	4
legitimate szechuan and cantonese recipes executed with excellence in generous portions , all at a fair price . i have been here twice since my check-in and i will say this place epitomizes the old saying : do n't judge a book by it 's cover . the location ,	4
as my first dinner in mesa - i looked to yelp and found my answer . with my usual enormous dinner appetite i decided that a <unk> indian buffet was right up my alley . i showed up around 7pm and was instantly seated at a <unk> , <unk> <unk>	4
dropped in about <unk> to test out what yelpers described as an excellent rendition of thai recipes . i was the 2nd customer in there , got instantly <unk> and went ahead and ordered the beef massaman curry at a medium spicy level for $ 11 . quality was superb	3
overall the food is really excellent and can only get better ... the only reason i did n't give five stars is because of service , and on this visit , the gnocchi was way over cooked and mushy , but the flavors on everything we got were so amazing	3
wow , i was surprised at how much i liked this place and the veggie sandwich we had . fresh yummy bread , very good tasting sandwich , just the right size , very fast service and cheap for what you get . the sandwich was enough to fill me	4
have been here several times now , and hands down the best indian food i 've ever tasted !!! love it and go back at least twice a month .	4
i hate to have to do this because all in all , i do like the food here , but a few things about them really turn me off and this last experience was my last straw . we went for lunch and our waitress ordered the wrong dish for	0
great place and it keeps getting better . their coffee is totally awesome -lrb- comes from coffee cartel , how could it not be ? -rrb- and the <unk> choices keep getting better and better . we love to go for breakfast and get tofu scrambles . their vegan desserts	4
i should be <unk> from reviewing anywhere that nobu cooks . my love runs that deep . so i 'll just drop off this 5-star and continue to post photos of every delicious meal .	4
remember when caffe boa was right on mill , next to red lantern and long wong 's ? remember when they were doing inventive , handmade pastas with fresh sauces and always had great specials ? remember the variety of flavors and the attention to detail ? remember the <unk>	1
butter burger . for breakfast . what part of that is <unk> ? no reason to waste space saying what has already been said : best breakfast in town . sure matt is mean to me . and i do n't go there enough . but my wife is 10	4
the decor , ambience is n't `` trying too hard '' , it 's just actually `` trying '' - to be something other than cookie cutter <unk> , and stand out from its gilbert <unk> old town surroundings . charming old world building with modern rustic elements woven in	3
i 'm hesitant to give 5 stars after 1 visit , but i have to . eating at the counter facing into the kitchen <unk> us a real look at how much care and attention is put into the food , even though it comes out at a great pace	4
decent if you 're jonesing for tapas . -lrb- this is not a paella review . yet . -rrb- i apologize in advance if this comes off as one of those reviews that makes managers and pr <unk> cringe . i know you ca n't do authentic tapas in <unk>	2
when we move home to houston , i am going to miss this place . my sister and i usually share the pesto pizza . my husband gets the pepperoni . the staff is attentive and efficient . parking is a hassle . it 's small , so there are	3
positive : warm and welcoming interior . attentive staff . every single item we ordered was extra tasty . i had the baked potato soup and the chicken salad sandwich . my co-workers really enjoy their roast beef sandwich and their breakfast options . negative : difficult to find ,	4
everyone on yelp is right , this place is great . it 's fast , fresh , and affordable . i created a roll filled with everything i like , and so i loved it . i got : white rice , seaweed , spicy salmon , green onion ,	4
this place is seriously amazing ! i first heard about them from restaurant wars . grilled cheese is one of my favorite things and so are cupcakes . naturally the 2 of them put together would be awesome right ? i thought it would be , everyone thinks it 's	4
i do not have enough good things to say about this place ... we just happened to be on the yelp app while in the area , looking for something delicious to try . we found it ! i had the ahi tuna burger no sprouts and add avocado .	4
grimaldi 's is my favorite pizza , there 's something about the crust and slight smokiness that make it special . i also love the pepperoni , it seems like it slightly thicker cut and that makes for a much <unk> flavor . the lack of ranch does n't bother	3
the food here was amazing ! daniel our server was awesome , very friendly and informative ! the french fries were some of the best fries i 've ever had . i ca n't wait to come back and try more !	4
well , i pretty much love nypd pizza . calzones are my favorite . i 've been ordering the frank sinatra with various fillings for years . absolutely adore the ricotta and i was extremely happy when they introduced the small size ... which is still big enough for 2	3
we came here on a thursday night with a large group of 20 plus . the place was extremely accomodating in that they let us form our own impromptu <unk> . the service was great . the servers <unk> on us as a group and individually . without even asking	3
we tried the chimichanga and the enchiladas here . they were both pretty good . the chimichanga was a little spicy but tasty . the chicken and shrimp enchiladas were very good . the place itself is really nice as the outdoor seating is really pretty and has a mini	2
i 'd come back . the sandwich was decent . my rye bread was burnt and the <unk> sauce was too sweet for my liking . but it was a large hearty sandwich with good ingredients . hard to find that is the area and from a bar . i	2
voted 2nd best sangria in phoenix ... well naturally you wonder who was <unk> <unk> the honor of first . that is what we were left to ponder while we enjoyed the many varieties of soft tacos . the waiter was friendly and recommended the 2nd best sangria in town	3
<unk> new york style thin crust pizza with simple topping combinations as it should . they also have a good selection of salads . we enjoyed the dining atmosphere -lrb- low key cafe -rrb- but the waitress we had kept trying to rush us to leave .	3
well we finally got in . about seven attempts and five years later we finally ate at pizzeria bianco . i think the only reason we got in is because they are now open for lunch . we were attending a matinee at the symphony and arrived 1.5 hours before	4
the peppercorn burger is amazing ! truly the best burger i have ever had . i 'm not a huge burger fan as i prefer a steak or chicken but this is worth stepping out of the comfort zone . when you walk in it 's a dark long bar	4
i do n't know what to say but absolute perfection , from the gelato , atmosphere , service , even the little cookie they put on the gelato . i 've had the salted caramel twice and it 's wonderful , rich and creamy . but not as many calories	4
i love this place . good wine in generous glasses , always a friendly staff and the shrimp appetizer is incredible . the bread is great , too great you always want more but they say it 's still baking it 'll take another 15 minutes ...	4
the food at matt 's is quite good . my issue is with the service . i 'm gluten-intolerant and so i asked for my breakfast that normally comes with potatoes and toast to have extra potatoes instead of toast . i was taken aback when the server said no	1
we had brunch at el chorro today and it was wonderful . the patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters . the service was outstanding . the food was delicious . i had the creme brulee french toast - it was <unk> heaven . everyone else enjoyed their food	4

decided to stop in here after a late evening run to the post office on van buren . do n't know if it was the time i was there -lrb- 8:00 pm on a monday -rrb- or the weather -lrb- storm coming in -rrb- but there were n't very many	3
went shopping here late friday night ... as in 9 pm . this store has always attracted me for some reason ... maybe because it seems like a piece of history or something . there are n't too many upscale department stores left in mid-town phoenix anymore . in fact	3
the bloody marg is really good . pricey , but thats par for the course at scottsdale quarter .	2
i love this place !! such a cool , unique vibe . i love the assortment of broths -lrb- if you like hot , get the tom yum or house spicy -rrb- . the choice of veggies and meats is extensive . i always wind up having to google some	4
delicious food . if you are opting out of wine , try the cucumber honey lemonade . it is so crisp and refreshing ! you can not go wrong with the bruschetta -- my favorite is the roasted pepper and goat cheese . i could have done without the toddlers	3
nom nom nom . great lattes . i like the vibe of the phx location -- very chill .	4
cute restaurant , average lunch . i had the bleu cheese burger , and it was good . not outrageous , but good . this is a good place to meet girlfriends and the girls i went with enjoyed their breakfasts .	2
the first night we went here it was very quiet and we enjoyed the wild mushroom soup $ 18 . enough that we would return the following evening for another 2 bowls . the lobster salad $ 18 was just okay , the lobster was on the tough side .	2
needed a quickie for the road trip back to the desert sanctuary so i stopped in for a croissant . well i must say their bakery was impressive . i had to have a <unk> , which is a wonderful puff pastry filled with <unk> and topped with sliced almonds	3
born and raised here , got smart and leave for the summers . i love phoenix in the winter ! green grass , cool weather flowers , glorious sun , resort wear , swimming , cocktails by an outdoor fire vs snow boots , scraping the windshield of ice ,	4
this is the best burger i have had in a very long time . if you are craving a good burger , you have got to try this place !!	4
definitely leans more toward the korean flavors than japanese . the food was very good and the provided a lot of it ! it is a very popular place and can get a bit crowded , but most of the folks there were regulars and all having a good time	3
i was so hoping to find a good barbecue restaurant near our house . unfortunately joe 's real bbq just misses the mark . the food tasted watery like it had been steamed to keep it moist . beans & slaw were just average . cool place inside and is	0
lettuce wraps !	4
good food and ice cool beer ! what more can you ask for . the chilie is awsome	3
not very impressed with this pizza joint . the hostess will not place you on the waiting list unless all of your party is with you . so do n't bother getting there early to get a table for your peeps unless you enjoy waiting that much longer . pizza	1
great bartender	3
i always look forward to their ice cream sodas . they have great daily specials too . they have good old fashion home cookin ' ambient - retro .	3
the green chile burrito was different from what i 've had in the past . they use oregano vs cumin to flavor the meat . i ca n't say i 'm in favor of it .	1
love their white pizza . their two slices and a soda combo , great value . and <unk> delicious ! the place is quite small indoors , but in a pinch you can sit out doors and people watch or take it to go .	3

i do n't even know where to start with z ` tejas . i guess it started with the one on mill , but we live closer to this one on ray near i-10 . the one on mill is great for people watching and i have taken visitors there	3
i do n't live close to a trader joe 's , so any time i get near one i have to go in and look around . they also have a few items i ca n't find anywhere else , such as their garlic olive oil that is very reasonably	3
can not love this place more ... like save up all your pennies and open a franchise and work a million hours love it . i have to say the best drink is the freeze in any flavor - so much so that in the winter i just put on	4
great small place to grab a quick sushi bite . good wine pairings and sake selections . rolls are almost all identical to each other . the cherry and orange blossom are great but my <unk> is the `` atkins roll '' wrapped in cucumber not seaweed and rice ...	2

clean establishment . rows of freezers in the back . hidden from the street . greeted by name what must be one of the regulars . carries both modelo and dos equis . slowly made food for being dead . the green enchilada sauce is a must . green chile	3

if i had n't recently found yogurtland in scottsdale i would be raving about this place . unfortunately it is 45 cents an ounce and the other place is 30 cents . both have a nice variety of flavors but this place is missing the water cooler . you do	2
i love this place after years and years of going . i always get the turkey salad and am never disappointed . service is quick and efficient . atmosphere is nice too .	4
yay !! finally a yogurt place that has a kids cup and they let you use one if you 're not a kid . love the flavors . love the toppings . the only negative is that they put new product on top of old product when the container is	4

the first time i went here , the food was pretty good and i really had no complaints . the second time - what the heck happened ??? the name of the game that night was how much salt can you <unk> in one meal before a stroke occurred ?	1
great new addition to downtown chandler . this is an upscale thai restaurant with a hip , cool interior . the food is thai and thai fusion and very good . try the awesome halibut dish . the owner and his mother really contribute to a friendly , fun atmosphere	4
it is a bit expensive - i mean it 's pizza for god 's sake . beyond that though i enjoyed the food there . the pizzas are <unk> even down to very similar toppings . for me it was about as good as bianco without the ridiculous wait .	3

the place is too crowded and cramped inside and the happy hour only runs until 6pm while chandler 's other three bars go until 7pm . they charge more -lrb- $ <unk> -rrb- at their own brewery for a draft than other bars who carry their beer . when your	1
came here to watch a live boxing event . it was a nice experience to watch boxing on the big screen . theatre was only 3/4 full , so it was just about right . popcorn and a candy can be had for under $ 7 as well . close	3
still good , but place is too crowded now at almost any time it seems . they were out of their famous sweet potato tots at 7pm on a weekday and pineapple aioli tasted off . go for the chipotle aioli - much better . backyard bbq burger was pretty	4
even though the baked rigatony is nowhere near the quality of anything baked with cheese in new york , this is still a great lunch deal with good food . the rigatony needed a bit more ricotta and mozzarella to be a contender ad there was too much of a	3
kinda <unk> , but so is zipps in charging me 50 cents for an extra small cup of dressing . the salad is pretty big to begin with and you only get a small cup of dressing . i ran out halfway through and big dude with beard gives me	2
the way to go here is the burrito bowl for $ 6.25 . two scoops of rice and beans and chicken and it is a large portion . yeah , the tortillas are fresh , but they stick to the paper on to-go orders . i did find out that	3
quite crowded on a friday during the tail end of the happy hour . lots of big parties and some regular <unk> crowding the bar . the happy hour deals are ok , but nothing crazy . two bucks off about five appetizers including their popular wings that everybody swears	3
this is the first restaurant that i have seen that is open until exactly 9:15 pm . it is an odd closing time and maybe they were in a rush at 8:45 pm packing my to-go order because my two spring rolls at $ 2 were left out . the	0
probably the worst chicken parmesan sandwich ever and even worse chips . it was the monday $ 5 special and it was far from special . they had no hostess which already is a big problem at the door . only one guy working the bar , waiting tables and	0
just cause a place has been there awhile and it is always crowded , does n't mean its good and that is the story at harlows . alot of people really do n't know any better and stay in their routine . two belgian waffles were ordered and neither of	0
every other focaccia bread i have purchased , you can just break a piece off and enjoy right out of the bag , but this herb focaccia -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- at tammie was n't like that . it was <unk> , so it needed a trip to the toaster	0
nothing special about this place - just another thai food joint in a strip mall . the chicken pad thai at 10 bucks was oily and wet and was n't that appetizing at all . it was a big portion , but that was the only plus side . then	1
clearly a decent place to watch sporting events , but they could use some more food specials considering their entire menu is $ 5 overpriced . all their pasta 's are between 12 and 15 bucks , which is not ok , considering this a big chain and the pasta	0
otto is on a roll - a very big pizza roll . for only 9 bucks , i received a monster meal that in my case had chicken , mushrooms , tomatoes and mozzarella cheese inside the incredible fresh pizza dough . all of this was served with a side	4
party in the woods . this place is quite far up in north scottsdale or pinnacle peak area , but it is a placed that is housed in an 130 year old <unk> and there are mostly good qualities about the legendary establishment . we went on a friday night	3
new owners have turned this bar into a gulp ... <unk> twins bar . i 'm sure they will draw large crowds for twins games . very selfish of the owners . nobody cares about the twins and even when tourists come in winter , they are n't playing .	1
we just went over to hit golf balls because this place is suppose to have an all automated driving range which of course is not true . only 15 of the 65 or so slots are automated and most of those are usually full . another negative is charging us	2
love the size of the pizza , ask the hostess how big it is before you order . the personal size is huge enough to feed two .	3
it 's a new find for me . i went on the weekend before the exam week , the place was packed with students ... high on caffeine and loud music . the best part is that it opens till 2am which is perfect for <unk> like me . the	3
great corn bread ! everything is average in taste , service is good but you can get bored of it soon as they do not change their menu or make new stuff	2
fast food greek is not very <unk> around the valley so this is a good alternative ... not great , but you can fulfill your gyros craving here . it is a chain so be prepared for a slight lack of authenticity if you know your greek food . everything	2
very authentic japanese in an elegant , clean , and inviting atmosphere . the sushi is always fresh and their exotic specials -lrb- ask chef as they 're hidden from the general crowd -rrb- are excellent . do n't expect americanized super rolls here . this is the real deal	4
some of the tastiest persian food i 've ever had and you will ever probably have in the valley . order the `` <unk> '' -lrb- or something to that effect -rrb- for an appetizer and you 'll be pretty close to ethnic food heaven . their kebab plates are	3

i want to keep going here , i really do . i want to drink from the massive amounts of beer selections , munch on soft pretzels and converse with friends . but i need some space . the roosevelt has become popular and that means scottsdale people have <unk>	3
i love this place for breakfast . with just a few menu choices , it 's tough to go wrong . my personal fave , the switch benedict is a tasty combo of potatoes and eggs benedict is a scrumptious white hollandaise sauce . it may not be good for	3

my only disappointment with the habit is that it 's so far away from me . seriously . i was in tempe to get my hair cut , and had some time to kill , so i went into the habit to check out their menu . i ended up	3
in the <unk> for a little beef ? how bout a big zinburger ? they 're wonderful ! juicy , yummy and huge ! the shakes are fabulous as well and only because the burgers are so delish have i not tried a salad . busy , busy place and	3
delish burgers . small menu , but i think that 's a good thing . very large burgers with a fabulous flavor . i hesitate to even write this , because it can be hard to get in to this place -lrb- it 's pretty small to begin with -rrb-	3
if my neighbors , joe and craig -lrb- like you care what their names are -rrb- had n't discussed this place in my presence , i would n't be here today . i ordered the huevos rancheros , and my husband ordered the steak and eggs . he loved his	4

this is my kind of place . i used to really enjoy going to <unk> years ago and having lavosh and cheese in the midst of my shopping . i can do this at postino . there is a sense of the quiet and the casual where a man -lrb-	3
i have to say i had probably one of the best dining experiences of my life the other day when we went for lunch at aiello 's and for a reasonable price as well . i was quite surprised to say the least . the location would not lead you	4
tonight i spent $ <unk> for a burger , shake , and fries . the service could n't have been better . really nice people there and it was fast . the restaurant was really clean , a plus with me . the custard kind of shake was pretty good	2
this was a nice place to go and have some different types of food on a busy first friday . have n't had to much experience with the food but it certainly had some interesting flavors . the setting was fun as well . i thought my blue corn enchiladas	3
this is a nice place to stop if you 're short on time and would like a healthier option . there are plenty of vegetarian options on the menu , and you 'll find pitas , sandwiches , and salads that are a nice change from other chain lunch stops	2

love the chicken chipotle pizza along with the stuffed pizzas . there are at least three or four appetizers that are top notch as well . this place is always crazy crowded , but the food is excellent .	4

i tend to go more for the independently owned breweries , but i enjoy rock bottom . as with any large chain , i suggest sticking to the seasonal beers made available , as they tend to have more character and depth than the standard fare offered every day .	2
without a doubt the freshest sushi i 've ever eaten . i stuck to the plan of `` order what 's on the special board '' and `` take the server 's advice '' and it did n't fail me . at all . i love me some <unk> crab	3
oh , tasty ! very tender vindaloo , and the chicken tiki masala was fantastic . i ca n't call myself an expert in indian cuisine , but my <unk> palate was quit satisfied . staff was efficient and friendly . i think i 'll make this a regular lunch	3

apparently this is a california staple , and it just opened here in the valley . via a friend , we popped in after dinner last night . our friend was having a difficult time explaining the texture of this new <unk> ice treat , we just had to experience	3
i always feel so high brow and <unk> when i go to trader joes , even though i 'm wearing cut-off flip flops , surrounded by louis <unk> <unk> desperate <unk> . actually , i was following my wife around the store like the good husband i am . we	3
it was actually raining at our house on saturday . that never happens . so instead of staying in , we headed over to fashion square to catch a movie . it 's a small theater but they offer the latest releases . we arrived early to catch a <unk>	3
i think this food is phenomenal . this was the first place i tried asian food in az when moving out here years ago . it has grown since then and the food is always top notch . for a late sunday afternoon lunch , the place was nearly empty	4
we 've been wanting to eat here for some time , and last night we had a very good experience . we made it in for their daily happy hour specials and got several drinks , an app , and 2 entrees for under 40 bucks , including tip .	3
we checked this place out for a sunday happy hour yesterday . very cool decor , on the hot spot that is the light rail in cenpho -lrb- which is like saying `` scotts '' or `` <unk> '' or `` the <unk> '' ... i hate trendy -rrb- .	3
yes , she was here ! julia baker herself . do n't know her ? me neither ... and then i met her and tasted the goodies she makes , and now i will never forget her . even more impressive was that she was so normal ! like a	4
this is our go-to work happy hour spot ... it 's close to the hospital -lrb- do n't know if that 's a good or bad thing -rrb- and they have really good happy hour specials . everyday of the week they offer a food and/or drink special . i	3
i have to agree with my wife . the place is big , but they pack you in like freaking sardines . our table was probably a <unk> foot table and were rubbing shoulders with couples on either side and behind us . the validated parking is considerate . but	1
our first stop on a bike pub ride . i 've been here before and it feels like a bar . it 's not crowded , there is not <unk> music playing . there is a pool table and lots of oak . it 's a place for sitting at	3
we 've been `` trying '' to catch this place for a while . if we go out for breakfast , it 's usually on a sunday , and by the time we realized that essence bakery is n't open on sundays , we are forced to head back to	4
i ca n't believe how age and wear and tear grind on the body . i use to be able to do this , i thought , much better ! i had an online coupon so i took my wife for some indoor rock climbing . she had never been	4
this place has been on the list for years , and finally after getting our act together , we met another couple for a dinner at olive and ivy . the decor , in traditional fox style , is perfect . from the lights to the tile to the bathroom	4
the happy hour here is the best in town . the food quality is top notch and the drinks are stiff . plus , there 's something cool about cheap happy hour in such a nice place . only eaten off the regular menu once , and the food was	3
this was our first visit here . we arrived just at the end of happy hour , so our really cool server kept saying `` ok , you have about 2 minutes before happy hour is over '' and we were able to get a couple of drinks and rolls	4
day drinking in scottsdale is a past time i have not appreciated enough . on this wonderfully cool afternoon , we were walking home and a friend in our group says `` hey , you want to get a drink '' . how novel ... it was kinda quiet ,	3
extremely cool spot . polynesian , trendy , contemporary , retro ... and full of <unk> `` mature couples '' , extremely hair <unk> scottsdale dudes , and giant <unk> , ultra <unk> scottsdale girls . i fit right in with my old <unk> wear ... i havent ' had	2
i lived in san luis <unk> for a few months and they have one of the best weekly , outdoor farmers markets i 've ever been to -lrb- in the u.s. anyway -rrb- ... and not counting the <unk> farmers market in atlanta . the <unk> market had tons of	3
after another 2 weekends of somewhat gluttonous living , we had to come here to get our greens fix . i just love this place . the greens and fixins are so fresh . and they try to update every now and then so that you have squash or beets	4
do n't eat here ! looked nice from the outside . there were over 12 empty tables , 2 couples waiting , and still we were told it would be a 25 minute wait . decided to have a drink at the bar . we were the only 2 people	0
excellent service this go around ! our waitress <unk> on us and our pooch patio side it made me forget the mediocre service i 've had here in the past . coffee , water , and food was all brought out quickly and with a smile . i had the	4
we ended our restaurant week experiences with a <unk> meal at province . oh how happy . the restaurant is absolutely beautiful . very modern with clean lines and impeccable organization . we tried to sit outside , but it was still way too hot and they easily accommodated us	4
while my daughter was attending a birthday party across the street , a couple of the dads and i decided to escape the <unk> affair by grabbing lunch and some drinks at sol . when i walked in , i was very impressed with the vibe . it 's dimly	3
rating this place could go any number of ways , depending on where you sit . due to the <unk> way in which we entered , we managed to experience a little bit of everything here . my wife and i agreed to meet the in-laws here on a friday	2
in exchange for watching our little one , my in-laws proposed that we meet up at crackers & co to make the switch . a new breakfast place and we get a date day ? i 'm game ! when we first arrived , i was a little skeptical .	4
pretty much done with nello 's ahwatukee ... it is now the parlor - part ii wannabe they have killed what used to be really good pizza - no one , and i mean no one there can make a pizza like george used to . what a shame and	1
ok , as of <unk> they may be back on track at nello 's ahwatukee ! went there this past week and had a great experience -lrb- as in the past -rrb- . pizza was cut in squares again and had a great <unk> salad . the owner was making	3
i 'll give roka credit , the must have read my review , offered to make the next visit a better experience and offered a gift card , so i 'll give them another try . hoping for another <unk> experience again .	2
cool place , comfortable . sorely needed in the ` tuke . went for lunch today . slow ordering process and a bit crowded with food items on shelves right behind the ordering line ... need to move that stuff and free up space for people to comfortably read the	2
the chaos and the `` no-frills '' ambiance in this place reminds me of <unk> in los angeles , but the service does not . being pretty busy on a weekend night , one had to literally walk over to someone to get banchan and even pay for the bill	2
for our anniversary my wife and i decided to try the mission to see it would live up to the hype . first impression when walking through the door is that it was a bit loud . but it being a friday night we were necessarily surprised . had made	4
first off , the place is cheap . burritos run around $ 4 . plates with rice and beans a $ 1-2 more . the mexican food is <unk> with other hole-in-the-wall joints from california that i grew up on loving . quality flavorful carne asada but a bit on	3
the service here is great . at least while sitting at the bar it is . the food is good and the beers are good . the have a very nice selection of drafts which is great . i usually try a different house beer every time i 'm there	2
this place has great food , great service and is in a great location . the lunch specials are a good deal , but if your eating and drinking here for dinner your tab will be pretty high . just make sure you check the beer and wine prices before	3
beer , beer , beer , wow ! what a great selection . i really love the fact this place has so many different beers to try . they even have these things called flights where you can get 4 5 ounce beers for $ 8 . not to shabby	2
this place is old school great . classic tavern . cheap drinks and no <unk> stuff . not a great selection of liquor but they have the basics . surprisingly they have stella artois on tap . of course many of patrons were drinking pbr the night i was there	3
very , very hip , trendy place to hang out . they have it all here . great place for families and hipsters alike . the shopping looks really cool with vintage clothing galore . the pf flyers were especially interesting . tried the <unk> pack of sliders , brisket	3
i have been going to this hard to find place for years . it was recommended by a friend from the frist moment i bit into the crispy crust i was hooked . i will talk about the food in a moment but my favorite part of classic italian is	3
uncle sam 's is getting four stars from me specifically for its happy hour . everything here is at least as good as you 'd expect from a divey pizza joint staffed by chicks in short skirts . not my thing , but they were nice enough and i had	3
my meal at fnb last weekend was one of the best i 've had in arizona . i love everything about this place , the food , the cocktails , the staff , the atmosphere . it was a rainy sunday . i knew the restaurant was right next to	4
liberty market is a great place to meet friends or family for a good , casual meal . the work that has been put into this space has payed off , and the pride the owners take in their business is evident . i 've been here four times ,	3
delish , but overpriced for a burger joint .	2
oh matt , <unk> , <unk> did you have to move ? who cares that your old place was small ? it was part of the quaint location . no matter ... your food is still worth waiting in the beaming heat . keep it up with the ` no	3
pleasantly surprised by this hidden spot in a quiet shopping center . almost across the street from the <unk> . owner is very informative . more smiling faces and street advertising would help . has a <unk> atmosphere . unsure of free wifi , would be great though . been	3
i 'd heard of this place time and time again . so i finally thought i 'd give it a whirl . when you 're driving there from the <unk> , you think you 're in the wrong place : industrial , low income homes , etc. . but when	2
and again , i 've given it another try but still a bit disappointed . oh well , it 's something to do on rainy days . i do so enjoy the <unk> room . and the snack room is great , minus some of the pricing .	1
good customer service , clean , yummy fresh food ... guess that 's why it 's a wait for the food downer : no smiling faces behind the counter . no free wifi , although it says it does on site . * location is kinda hidden from ray rd	2
it 's a nice place to relax and chit chat with friends , or just come to enjoy a nice cup of coffee and a good book . i will definitely come back and try their latte : -rrb-	3
i will definitely come back to this place when am craving for good pad thai . i have to say so far the best in phoenix .	3
i am in love with the cinema suite ! being able to stretch out your legs on the <unk> recliner is the way to enjoy the movie . the chair is spacious and the room is not crowded with <unk> . the foods are at a reasonable price and the	4

i moved here last december and so far this is my favorite pizza spot . i had the thin crust -lrb- whole wheat -rrb- chicken pesto pizza and it was amazing !! i love pesto . and there have been a couple occasions where my friends and i have gone	4
i had mixed feelings about this place . if i could i would give it a 3.5 . pros : fast and polite service . i like the idea of being able to order and try a bunch of different things . the variety of protein choices is great and	2
bungalow is one of my favorite places for happy hour . they have good specials and i love the happy hour food . that grilled cheese is gon na give me a heart attack <unk> day but its soooo good . i 've also come here for a nice lunch	3

i really do n't like bbq but the boyfriend does so every once in awhile i had to please him . so i have to rate this place mostly according to him . i had the catfish fingers . which were great , but kind of hard to mess up	2
i 've only been here once but this place is pretty legit for pizza . i like places with a lot of variety for pizza since i 'm a total weirdo and refuse to eat tomato sauce . i had chicken pesto . i am usually a thin crust person	3
i was super excited to try petite maison after the rave reviews here on yelp , and also because my husband and i will be going to paris later this year and felt some french food would get us into the spirit . unfortunately for us , this was pretty	1

before a suns game recently , my family and i stopped into blue hound for some drinks and appetizers . we attempted to go to arrogant butcher -lrb- been there many times -rrb- , but it was packed . having heard good things from another family member , we decided	3

loved , loved , loved this place ! hubs and i went here for date night yesterday and have nothing but great things to say about this restaurant . we shared everything and had the duck fajitas , catfish , green chili mac and cheese , and the `` mushroom	4
it is just as one would think of when you would want some good food made from scratch daily with some of that quintessential homemade flavor and love . when there are local food that <unk> the heart and culture of a city lolo 's would be a big part	4
i like that they have a huge variety of drinks . so many that i never can decide and end up in a <unk> and ordering the same thing every time . the red bean slush is so good and they put a scoop of the red bean on top	3
when comparing this place to the previous hodori of days past it has gone down hill considerably . i have seen it 's ups and downs but with changing of hands as if it were <unk> this place has been through a lot . the current owner who ever it	3
i have been here a couple times . the first time i went it was still under the shanghai palace name . i heard that shanghai palace was the only place in town that had soup dumplings . when i went i turned out the place changed hands to tottie	0
with a name like cask 63 we expected a <unk> experience . major disappointment . the interior is little changed from the previous restaurant - certainly nothing that <unk> to the <unk> name . the wine was just so-so ; we had to return on dish as it was over	1
japanese food - so yummy definitely a stop when you have a japanese food craving . excellent quality ; very good prices . the wait staff is also very good . hard to beat that combination .	3
oregano 's has a major following - basically they give one a lot of good food for a moderate price . small wonder that families flock to the place . we had a pizza - next time i 'll stay with a salad .	2
this place is a good escape in the scottsdale scene . it feels like rocky point spring break but super upgraded ! there is no better place to sip a corona then at dos gringos without a passport , at least .	3
i love this place ! the pizza is so good and it never disappoints . i went to school down in tucson and they just opened one near arizona stadium , i screamed when i saw the sign for the one in tucson i was so excited . now i	4
love love love the biltmore ! by far my favorite macy 's ever ! because they have more upscale merchandise but the same sales as every other macy 's . i have found some amazing shoe deals here ! i also enjoy the set up and browsing through the stuff	4
cute , quaint , simple , honest . i really like this place . the pad thai is n't the best i 've had , but it 's still very good . the portion is large , and the price is reasonable . the green curry is really good .	3
pane bianco is a refreshing breath of air . after having a bad experience at pizzeria bianco , i was pretty hesitant to try pane . my husband talked me into going , and i 'm really glad that he did . restaurant is located next to lux , so	4
nice , new stadium . lots of parking options -lrb- cheaper spaces that are further from the stadium and vice <unk> -rrb- and lots of places to buy food . the seats are a little small and uncomfortable , but i would n't mind going back and watching another game	2
ohhh wow . delicious . my husband and i love gallo blanco , so we had to try otro cafe . the location is interesting ; the restaurant is open and spacey , which i think i prefer to gallo , and the seating is more comfortable . i really	4

this is a very interesting , very informative museum . the architecture of the building is beautiful and simply adds to the extensive , well displayed exhibits . i was a little disappointed that a good amount of the art on display is modern -lrb- made in the last 4	3
good selection , well stocked , and fairly reasonable prices . i like the food and wine sections best - lots of my favorite british desserts , candies , and chocolates at decent prices . also a good place to go if you need to find a gift for someone	3
this place is alright . it 's large , and has a ton of large tvs which i think would be good for watching a football game . the beer selection is large , the food is average , and the service is good . i 'd go back ,	2

there is n't a better place to take a date in phoenix . the owners are always present and welcome guests as old friends . the patio is absolutely gorgeous and has live music on the weekends . the inside is a bit cramped , but is bursting with ambiance	4
i want to <unk> this place every time i try something new here ! i think the chai tsoynami changed my life last week . but maybe i 'm only saying that because i am lost in a post chocolate <unk> cupcake high . so rich . so moist .	4
i have been here many times over the years , even celebrating my 2 year anniversary with my sweetie here . i like that they have an amazing selection of cheese , my total weakness . recently we went to one of their specialty dinners and the experience was top	3

i had to review this place again because i have decided it is my favorite neighborhood spot hands down ! i went last night on a whim with my fiance after we both had a very long day and were starving . the pasta fries were amazing and the dipping	4
really nice fancy mall . reminds of the the <unk> malls in texas . i like how most of their kids clothing stores are in one hall of the mall . makes getting stuff for the kiddo a breeze .	3
i 've been to 3 mills malls and this is probably the least impressive . i do n't like the way it is set up with the food court in the `` back '' and do they really have to have <unk> <unk> rides every few feet ?!?!?! i 'm	2
the spring rolls were good and the food we ordered was a-ok . that about sums it up . not the great vietnamese food i ever had but it 's hard to go wrong with fish sauce ! service was decent , too . we had the noodle salad and	2

it was quite refreshing to walk into the herb box and not have to wait to be seated for an hour in old town scottdale on a sunday . the ambiance is one <unk> feels fancy but yet its like the comfort of your home . the service received was	3

i love that this place . is an old warehouse converted to be a night club . early in the evening the place was n't as packed . there is a nice little dance floor for some fun and pool tables in the back . also available is a small	3
a great place to grab a bite if you 're out of time and happen to be downtown . notable dishes which i recommend are the spicy korean and tai mango chicken . i mean if you really wanted to try something spicy , healthy and delicious , you would	3
funk yeah ! this place is the sheet for chilling downtown without the frown . where else are you going to swamp yourself in artisan suds as well as the classic <unk> ? <unk> question -- no where . just the tips : - roast beef sandwich is mostly awesome	3
you ca n't go wrong when you can get comfort food and southern hospitality until midnight . chicken , waffles , grits , greens , corn bread ? yes , please ; all of the above plus some purple drink , too ! i 'd avoid the early weekend mornings	4

this place is a hidden gem and when driving through here for years i have to say the exterior makes me a bit weary on whether this place is capable of producing great food . we decided to stop by for lunch with a few compadres from the office .	3
we went here for their easter brunch and enjoyed our meal , the view at this place is awesome and the staff are up to par for a hyatt . wish i can say it 's anything more , but the service and cost for the complimentary champagne is a-okay	2
good food here the cocktails are great , definitely a bit too pricey for my experience eating at these type of places . i would recommend it more if they were a bit more realistic with the price for the portion . or maybe i just do n't like the	3
this place deserves a great review for it 's concept and uniqueness . do n't come here if you are expecting the norm . this multi purpose building -lrb- boxing gym , bar , clothing shop , bike shop , bar , pie shop , restaurant -rrb- can be a	3
best lunch spots at the biltmore if you are looking for a fairly well priced sushi selection . i am a big fan of their bento 's , they pack them with two salads , lettuce and cucumber and finish them off with your favorite fish , chicken or meats	3
delux has been a great spot for years and many burger joints have tried to copy this concept and they are good but there is one delux . the french fry 's on a cart of pretty bananas and the sweet potato style cart is just as great if not	3

a solid place to get a freshly prepared burger . i like their onion rings also .	2
not a bad place to eat . a little pricey for what you get . nice location with a patio . good place for happy hour .	2
a much better option than subway for a quick sandwich . many options for customization .	2
good destination for pizza . would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when i worked in the area . nice new york style pizza with a crisp crust .	2
good food for a pretty good price . it 's not spectacular by any means but prices are good given the size and quality of the burgers and sandwiches . the sweet potato fries are good , onion rings are a little above average and the service is great .	2
awesome sandwiches . i 've been here a few times now and every time , the sandwiches are fresh and filling . this is probably my favorite sandwich shop in town . the service is great and all of the staff are always friendly .	4
i have friends who love this place , but it 's really just bland and overpriced . $ 13 for a small burrito , taco , and drink is way too much for what it is . i would n't go out of my way to come here , but	1
i cant say i was amazed ! the salsa was <unk> likely and the food was about standard , nothing that i would write a <unk> review about . . we ordered the app sampler <unk> , everything was covered in beans and lettuce , it didnt seem as if	2

let 's just say that i spend far too much time here . the service is always good , as is the food . eating the chili lemongrass chicken for the first time ... it <unk> me ... greatly .	3

i love fez ! i have had great food and drinks whether it 's been in the evening for dinner and drinks or on sunday for brunch . my favorite is their brunch ; my biggest problem is trying to decide exactly which item i want to get . between	3

because it 's friday and i 'm in the mood to celebrate , it 's time to review the ultimate disneyland for drunks . total wine , you are the bees knees . the proper mindset for this review should not be `` i 'd like a beer with dinner	4
this review is based solely on the market , since i have n't actually ordered food here . that being said , la tolteca rocks . there 's a christmas tradition that i partake of , and it <unk> me all sorts of problems . every year i cater a	3

been here several times to watch games or the draft . the best thing here are the ko 's <unk> sauce wings . not overly tangy like buffalo wings . good flavor and pretty meaty . i like that their pizzas are thin crust . good service .	3
been here 3 times so far . the staff has treated me and my family well , the food i got tasted very good , and the beers have been good as well . i 'm not sure where these bad reviews came from because i 've never had the	3
wow . this bookmans feels different from my usual stores . neither better nor worse ... interestingly different . just wish they were n't being <unk> by the construction so much .	2

i love pita jungle just as much as the next person , but i have experienced seriously inconsistencies between all 4 locations i 've frequented . sometimes the food -lrb- esp the hummus -rrb- is so incredibly salty that i ca n't even taste the hummus for what it is	3
this place certainly delivers on the ambiance factor , but ... $ 14 for a salad ? really ? and $ 9 for a plate of kale ? really ? i think this place needs to get over themselves on the food pricing . mind you ... that kale salad	3
i went here once and i can not stop dreaming about the roasted corn pizza ! the goat cheese on it was perfect and the roasted sweet corn added a nice pop to every bite ! i also ordered the pizzeria chopped salad which was just okay , it was	3
out of all of the local indian restaurants i have tried , royal taj is by far the best ! the curries are amazing and the meat -lrb- and paneer -rrb- is always tasty ! while the people who own the restaurant may seem a bit distant , they are	4
chill is amazing ! the gelato is amazing and so are the <unk> choices ! sandy is so kind and welcoming and very well trained in the art of making gelato ! the prices are also incredible ! be sure to try the cake batter flavor !	4
i 've tried several of their dishes . it 's ok . i did like their cocktail de <unk> but nothing special .	1
i 've been there 2-3 times , enough to give them a chance and enough to know i 'm not going back for meat purchases . not very friendly service and way overpriced . i 've found better service , better cuts , and 50 % of the price .	0
love the <unk> . excellent ingredients and mostly local !	4

now here 's a restaurant that knows how to do arizona restaurant week right . went here my brother over the weekend after a d'backs game . the place was n't that busy and we got excellent service throughout . the place is on the bottom floor of the westin	4
love the vibe here , but the food was a little disappointing . this used to be the old public market grocery store , but after the store closed , the owners of st francis restored it as an all day caf serving farm to table foods . the concept	2
its been a couple years since i last set foot here and quite a bit has changed . went to <unk> recently , but had n't had a chance to check out the breadfruit and its updated menu until tonight . the original place is still largely in <unk> ,	3

everything you 've heard about the stetson chopped salad is true . when my family and i booked this place for arizona restaurant week , we did so with the promise from friends that we would have a salad we 'd never forget . they were right . in addition	3
its a restaurant that 's still very much in its <unk> and still has some kinks to work out , but so far this new downtown spot is off to a pretty good start . my siblings and i took my dad here for father 's day . surprisingly ,	2

the food tasted a-ok but i 'm not in a rush to go back . i ordered the lamb shank -lrb- $ 21 -rrb- along with the basmati rice and the <unk> salad -lrb- $ 5.50 -rrb- . i thought the lamb was decent , but it did n't make	2
looks like i got lucky and found this place after a change in management per yelper kevin s. i 've been here three times in the last month and have been very pleased with the food . i had the huge , delicious meatloaf which is very difficult to finish	3

on our journey north to the musical instrument museum , we stopped at sapporo for lunch . the space is <unk> and hip and full of the typical scottsdale `` beautiful people . '' we started with edamame ... ca n't go wrong there . mom had the japanese chicken	2
my opinion of cpk : quinoa & arugula salad was outstanding . the fish tacos are skimpy . one taco had 2 pieces of fish that were roughly the size of fish sticks . the other taco had 2 teeny <unk> pieces of fish . i do n't like to	2
nothing extraordinary about this place . i had a house salad and a grilled halibut sandwich . the place was clean , the waitress was nice , the music was a little loud especially in the bathroom . that 's all i got .	2
bait and switch . the menu that is online is not the same menu that is in the restaurant . the online menu lists several vegetarian dishes , the restaurant menu does not . when my sister and i arrived we each knew what we were going to order ,	0

i like this place . have n't been in a while . . i should change that . they have great burgers and excellent pomegranate martinis !	3

joe 's real bbq is one of my favorite places . comfort food in a comfort environment served by friendly people - just the best . located in downtown gilbert , the historic brick building is solid and homey . we try to visit at non-peak hours or on weeknights	4
i wanted to love it so much !! i do n't mind the divey old school feel , i just felt the burger was not all it 's cracked up to be . it was juicy , but under seasoned , so it did n't have much flavor . the	1

first time eating here and it was really good . i went with the basic gyro plate . i love meats roasted on a spit ! this includes gyro meat , yellow rice , salad , hummus , pita , and portion cup of tzatziki . it is a large	3

always the pinot noir , always the 9 iron sandwich . however , i only go when the wine is $ 5 per glass , because i am such a value person . unless it is monday or tuesday , then i go with the $ 20 bottle and bruscetta	3
setting is beautiful ! food has been great before , but this time around it was fair . i hold expensive places to a higher standard . i was n't that excited to come back this last time around .	3
blue nile has great raw food . this is important , , because there are n't too many places available to get raw food now . although it is bit pricey , having raw food available is important , due to the role the <unk> plays in the human body	4
everything an <unk> experience should be !!! meaning a rare blend of exotic and common herbs and spices , mixed in <unk> combinations which made my palate believe i was tasting completely new flavors . menu is a tapas portions of japanese fusion -lrb- tapas is a spanish word for	4

first i love their chips and salsa , they have just enough heat to <unk> a delicious margarita . we then usually try the mexican pizza or the pork <unk> . the rest of their menus is great too , we just come for happy hour typically .	3
great breakfast burritos and salads . the smoothies are hit n miss , but once you find one you like you 're good . needs free wifi for the wait times .	3
really come on people , i had a thin dry ass over cooked bland hamburger and some undercooked cold fries . nasty . i wo n't be going back . price was right taste was wrong . the biker atmosphere and poorly prepared burgers will make sure i wont be	0

while to some folks its less `` authentic '' vibe is a problem , to me it 's perfect . i have taken several folks here , who are not originally from arizona and had never liked mexican food , and they leave here liking mexican food . to a	3
not bad , not bad at all . as a burrito it 's absolutely huge and even if you could , you should n't eat the whole thing . i am a big fan of getting it as a bowl so i can actually take smaller bites with a fork	3
wow this place is good ! so good ! and not just yummy good , but <unk> good . check out their amazing list of environmentally responsible business practices - <unk> ! that , and it 's cute . and it tastes yummy ! and they are so nice !	4
i finally made it to the top . i live 10-15 min away and appreciate it from here , have referred other folks to check it out , but have never even driven up there until today . so beautiful ! it only takes one or two turns to feel	4
this was my neighborhood restaurant . i 've eaten here more than i care to remember . their pollo fundito is permanently a part of my hips , unfortunately . i love sitting in their back room near the little waterfall , but the big room is fun too -	4

i used to have an office right down the street from here , and used to go there to hide out often . i just recently ended up back in gilligan 's for happy hour . the beer , wine and wells are $ 1.00 !!! ca n't beat that	2
this place is so much better than bookmans !! everyone was very friendly and the place was clean . i found all of the books i was looking for . they just changed their policy for trade in . they will only give you store credit , no cash .	3
i really like this place ... taking the advice of yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown . we were immediately greeted as we walked in . i told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best . following the recommendation	4

there is n't a sign out front at all but they must not need it because it 's pretty busy . we only know about it because my husband found it looking up restaurants online . there are no places whatsoever to sit and wait after you first get there	3
order the huge cookie thing that has melted chocolate and ice cream in it . amazing ! i think it used to be called pazookie but they do n't advertise it now apparently .	4
pretty <unk> , food-wise . i do n't think you 'll be disappointed if you 're looking for standard italian fare , but it 's the kind of stuff you can make yourself pretty easily at home . we kinda <unk> out here , as we bought the $ 20	2
just wanted to reiterate my enthusiasm for this place , especially after going and seeing that they have expanded to include donuts . big deal , right ? well , turns out they make them in coconut oil ! that 's highly impressive to me , given the fact every	4
this is the real deal . in saying that , i <unk> other `` japanese '' restaurants , whether some sort of fusion or <unk> or not . this is n't any yuppie 's vision of japanese cuisine located in a cookie-cutter strip mall next to a rubio 's fresh	3
certainly not terrible , but file under `` could use work . '' that said , i really think they should have <unk> the opening till they had more exhibits . that 's the biggest problem with this place ; most exhibits are incomplete or `` coming soon . ''	2

i 'm a little bit of a hippie at heart so i probably am biased when i say that i love this place and it 's likely my favorite spot in arcadia . a microbrewery with delicious food , a huge outdoor patio that 's dog-friendly , <unk> and helpful	4

2nd time i 've eaten here , was just as impressed as the first . the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous with a <unk> ambiance appropriate for families and groups . i took 11 friends from a movie we had seen over to the restaurant tonight . the food was incredible	3
i 'm not a big chain restaurant type of gal , but this place is top notch not only in service , but as well as quality of food . the fillet <unk> was tasty , perfectly cooked -lrb- medium -rrb- , and still sizzling hot on my plate .	4
the closest thing to mama 's home cooking and if you know how good my mama cooks ... well , the woman can cook ! their ceviche is big with fresh seafood . the <unk> <unk> comes in a big plate and worth every bite . the only thing i	4

this place is pretty cool ! if it were n't for the server who started out awesome and ended up rude , i would give it five stars . i guess three middle-aged patrons were n't nearly as interesting as a table full of girls ' night <unk> . once	3

great prices for pretty much anything you need . i just hate how long it takes to check out on weekends . the other thing <unk> directly to costco is how stupid the people in the parking lot are . also if you want to avoid your car being door	2
this is my kind of restaurant . very simple menu of things you would eat off the grill . burgers , hot dogs , brats all cooked over a charcoal grill . there was a bit of a wait in line , but the price and taste of the food	4

stopped in for a quick drink . i wanted tequila , but not a margarita and late-night , there was no drink menu around so i stuck with vodka soda , which ended up being a vodka water sans lime i sucked down before we got out of there !	1
great food , if just slightly overhyped . it 's a cute building in a great location with friendly staff , but does not win my vote for best pizza in phoenix , sorry ! definitely check it out though , it 's top five , but be prepared to	3
while i miss <unk> <unk> 's , this standard , <unk> bar is a decent , low-key , if a little <unk> option at tempe marketplace . the crowd leans a little older than cadillac , san <unk> 's or d & b . i just went to catch up	2

the pizza is really good . just make sure you 're on your a game - like other people have said , there are so . many . rules . i 've never caught attitude from an employee , but they 've got me <unk> .	3
lots of superior flavors in all of the dishes that i have had . doesnt matter if you order a pork dish , tacos , soup , whatever , it is all fun to eat . just a delight .	3
with most menus i stick to a few core items , but at windsor it is a great idea to try a lot of new food . the staff does not seem able to miss when it comes to a single menu item . the vibe and decor is superior	3
delicious cheap food . it is a `` <unk> '' place so plan accordingly . the food is remarkably filling as well .	3
i 've been wanting to try cherry blossom 's ramen for a while . since i ca n't get my <unk> fix here in az , cherry blossom will have to do . their ramen hit the spot and would be great on a cold day at home sick ,	3

great taco bar , nachos are amazing , fajitas are also excellent ! they have a huge selection of margaritas to choose from that are not the typical fruit . the jalapeno , cucumber , and hibiscus are all worth trying .	3
excellent food all around !! the <unk> was good , salad was interesting , and the pizza was exceptional . my favorite was the rosa pizza with a close second at the bianco pizza . the wait was n't too bad on a thursday night and with the bar next	3

as a fairly new connoisseur of greek food , this place is pretty good . i like their pita a lot , and the fire feta is quite addicting . the salad and rice are n't anything to write home about , and i 'm not crazy about the tzaziki	2

lindsey d. is right ... this place is way too popular ! after enjoying dinner at little <unk> 's , my friend and i went over to the yard for a drink . it was packed on a saturday night ! we had a hard time finding a place to	3
what a cool place !!! we went here with some friends and ordered about two plates a piece and shared . the plates are small and it gave us the opportunity to try a bunch of different things . my favorites were the red curry with tofu , the tofu	4
it 's a great mall with a lot of variety , but save your <unk> and either park underground -lrb- after 5 on weekdays or anytime on weekends -rrb- or around back . this place is always busy !! i 've seen many stores come and go but they have	4
girls ' night out . we stopped in here after dinner for some cocktails . i liked the decor immediately . dim , cozy , cool looking bar . i did n't really care for where we were seated , but it 's a cool place nonetheless . they have	1
i was working in the area and craving a healthy salad for lunch . my usual love affair salad place was too far so my colleague and i decided to try jason 's deli . he 'd gone there for sandwiches many times and never tried the salad bar .	3
this was our first time here and we went on a friday evening . it 's small and they do n't take reservations so just keep that in mind . we lucked out to arrive at a good time and did n't have to wait . there was about two	4
i really like the decor of chelsea 's kitchen . it 's simple , spacious , and has a warmth to it . parking is very limited but they do free valet . i actually like to park my car myself but you do n't really have a choice here	4
out of this world . great selection on the menu : sandwhiches , salads , noodle or rice bowls , etc. . i 've ordered the veggie burger , the pad thai , and a few of the other rice bowls and have never been disappointed . oh , and	4
i was way out west was n't i ? ok , first time at this arena . we went for a concert and was pleasantly surprised to find it pretty organized in terms of parking . they have multiple lots with <unk> price tags : $ 20 - $ 15	3
first time here , came on a sunday night for dinner . the inside is fairly small , but cozy . they have a large patio dining area with nice lights up , but it 's too cold for that so no one was out there . they have some	4
the concept of a seasonal menu is great , especially at seasons 52 where they have a weekly seasonal specials menu that changes each week , hence the 52 in the name . also each menu item is suppose to be <unk> appropriate and 475 cal or less . sure	4
this is a cool place ! it reminds me of an eatery that should be located up in <unk> . kind of a lodge feel , lots of wood , simple . i skipped the drinks this go ` round and went straight to stuffing my face . our table	3
went here for happy hour which they do from 3-6 <unk> . our table ordered $ 5 margaritas and the sangria , which were both very good . ordered the chips and salsa which came with pico and a nice chipotle salsa . we tried about 4 varieties of tacos	4
have been here several times and just realized have not written a review ! how blasphemous . was here on friday for happy hour . $ 2 off appetizers meant a dozen oysters for $ 10 . not bad . also indulged in some brews on tap . they have	3
i saw this place on pbs `` check please , az '' and decided to give it a try . it 's in a corner of a little strip mall and you can sit outside if you like . i 'll just say `` it 's ok '' . we	2
my first visit to `` the parlor '' . stopped in for a late lunch yesterday and snagged a table outside on the patio . we both ordered the spinach salad . it was loaded with bacon , tomatoes , white cheese , avocado and garnished with a sliced hard	4
first time here . had a late lunch today because we had a gift card from our son . this place is ok . that 's about all i can say ... 2 pizza 's + 2 beers = $ 30 . crust is very thin . go if you	1
short and sweet . 1st time to postino central and love the bruschetta ! omg it 's all good . i might come back very soon and order some `` to go '' . just a thought ... noise level is high . not a place for children . people	4
the food here is really spectacular ! we ordered the sweet potato planks , mussels and the shrimp and grits , and they were all delish ! the sweet potato planks are absolutely wonderful ! a must have for any visit there . the little rounds of sweet potatoes topped	4
i definitely had a 2.5 star visit . the extra .5 is because of the service . the mediocre 2 stars is because of my very blah turkey burger . i ordered a turkey burger , sans the bun -lrb- in my <unk> attempt to cut out carbs where i	1
i 've been to ticoz on several occasions -lrb- but not in several months -rrb- , and the food has always been good , and the drinks have always been better . so my friend and i decided that we would go there for happy hour on friday . we	1
if i lived on one of the <unk> , i would never go to joe 's . however , living in landlocked phoenix , joe 's is where i go when i need a crab leg fix without spending a ridiculous amount of money . i ordered the steamed shrimp	1
this place is terrible . the only reason i 'm giving 2 stars is because the waitress was very nice and tried to be accommodating . having lived on both <unk> , i 'm always skeptical of going to seafood restaurants in landlocked states , and have actually had some	1
i went here with a group for a pub crawl and they were really great ! they had us set up in a nice little private area off to the left of the hostess stand , which was a great set up for the type of event we were having	3
this was my first visit to this place in about <unk> months . the food is always outstanding , so no issues there . today i got the lamb <unk> plate , but <unk> chicken for beef . it comes with either greek salad or tabouli , and i always	2
this place has a great happy hour during the week . they usually have some kind of daily special , like 2 for 1 pizza ! the bruschetta is always good , though a little on the skimpy side compared to postino 's bruschetta . the pizza i had was	2
i was expecting regular shaved ice and was pleasantly surprised at what i found . it 's shaved ice , but with a definite twist . it 's not as literal as shaved ice , but instead is a light and airy substitute . they describe it as `` fluffy	4
food was good as expected , but service was slow . really not a problem since i was n't looking forward to returning to the office anyway haha . we got an appetizer salad to share and i ordered chicken <unk> lunch special which comes with soup , wonton &	2
sound system is good , seats comfy but the `` tables '' at each seat are a bit small & awkward . also the theatre is very dark which makes it difficult to see your food & especially difficult to pay your bill . the movie price was great -lrb-	2
first i should mention the worst part , they do n't open until 5pm . probably not an issue for most people , but i like to eat early ... this was my second time there and this time i was on a date . i love the decor ,	3
i ca n't go 5 stars because i hate self checkout and you have to do it there . other than that , the location is clean , items are fresh and in stock , and parking is easy . when one of the employees saw us stocking up on	3
i co-worker challenged me to a pizza taste test . their choice for favorite is pino 's , so we went there today . i ordered two slices of cheese pizza , since that is the fair way to sample ! the pizza is not bad , but not as	1
in <unk> seats ... well worth the the ticket price . the food is overpriced and some is much better than others . nice for going on a date night !	3
oh my ... delicious ! lunch plans with the girls led us to windsor on a lovely sunday afternoon . i had the crab cake blt ... crab cakes , yum ... add bacon ? amazing ! you have your choice of sides and i had jo 's church potatoes	3
the previous restaurant in this space did n't last long , but rehab burger therapy hit the nail on the head ! they have a great menu of food and drinks and some really tasty beers . there are about a dozen different burgers on the menu and the cool	3
ohhhh ... yummy !! i think i had something called the <unk> ... i love anything with caramel . this coffee concoction is particularly delicious as i later learned it is made with chocolate milk ! they also give you a punch card and after 10 drinks , you get	3
i have been to distrito 3 times now . and every time their food is some of the tastiest i 've had . their service however , leaves the customer often a little puzzled . the servers seem <unk> and as if you 're putting them out by dining there	3
<unk> good chocolate ! priced similarly to what you find at godiva , but you get chocolates that are even more delicious . the shop is gorgeous and the sales people are so sweet offering a sample and information about the chocolates . they have a cute sitting area including	3
i had to give it a full 5 stars as i 've never had a less than delicious experience here . i must 've been here 3 times in the last 2 months and at least a dozen times before that . i 've had nearly every beer they brew	4
like it !! the bf is more in love with this place than me . he always orders the <unk> ... pancakes with coconut , banana and sliced almonds . they are very tasty ! but i tend to prefer savory over sweet for my <unk> meals ... especially if	3
i love this place because they show the smaller indie flicks , <unk> films and foreign pics you ca n't get right away at the large theatres . whenever i want to see a movie and the big studio releases are unappealing , i always watch <unk> for whats playing	3
did not like it what so ever . i had to go because of my friends . i 'm allergic to shell fish by the way . all there non seafood food sucked . i use to enjoy <unk> here for their <unk> . but the last time i went	1
i go to this place on the way home from school . every time , i order the spicy lemon grass chicken with rice . it is really yummy . lots of flavor and veggies which i love . however , i dislike like how they give me only one	4
i do n't know much about authentic thai food but this place hits the spot . i have always hated thai food while growing up , i actually never really liked spicy food . however , my friend took me here once and i ordered the beef ma sa man	4
good place to go if you a fans of irish type of beer and/or any types of <unk> beer . i ca n't really handle the dark beer so i tend to not go there if i do n't have to . they do charge covers to get in ,	1
i only shop here because it 's close to where i work . not the <unk> location as the neighborhood is n't a good location . there are a lot of homeless and weird people hanging out in and out of the store .	1
great place to go to since this is the only place in downtown phoenix that 's actually lit up and actually have lots of shops to go shop at . many different restaurants to try out and a bowling place -lrb- lucky strike -rrb- for you to hang out and	3
i missed america west airlines , all the good services went down once us airways took over . meh , i think i 'll pass . the only reason i gave a 2-star is because this is still the hometown airline from phoenix , but not for much longer .	1
<unk> style western <unk> * heart * next closest place to get something like this is california * <unk> * the menu is ginormous . my only advice to you is to not order any of the americanized nonsense in the front of the menu and skip to the latter	3
i had the soppressata with aged provolone & roasted peppers . it was a solid sandwich overall . the quality of ingredients was pretty good , but the only part that gets me is the price . $ 8 + tax ? wow all that `` supply and demand ''	2
i am a fan of trader joe 's in general , but this location is my favorite amongst those that i frequent . parking : i 'm always concerned i wo n't find a spot , but i always do . they have a lot of shady parking spaces .	4
this new sprouts location is convenient and attractive . it 's set up like all the other sprouts , so it 's easy to navigate the aisles . in general , sprouts has above average produce , a good selection of vitamins and supplements as well as foods with mostly	3
i dined at fleming 's recently on the insistence of a friend , and while the service was good , i thought the food was shockingly high priced for what it was . i had a small filet . it was correctly cooked and tasted very good . just like	2
this place is awesome . a true representation of an old chicago style burger joint . the food is great and service is good . no complaints here . the sliders are amazing and the dog is wonderful too . you won ' be disappointed with this place !	3
this place rocks . great new york style pizza . always fast -lrb- they are always busy and it never takes longer than 20-30 minutes -rrb- . i 'm eager to try some other things on their menu , but when i go there , i just tend to get	3
great little bar . local patrons and cool vibe . do n't expect a party , but they mix great drinks , play chill music , have a rotating collection of artwork , and it 's a cool and friendly crowd .	3
i really enjoy pita jungle . this is another one of our go-to spots . food is always fresh and good . service is also good . food is reasonably priced and you can make it a longer casual dinner , or short and easy dinner -- your preference .	3
so it 's probably not very fair or objective , but hey , first impressions , right ? i went over for a slice for lunch around 1 pm . i 've always noticed that this place does not provide much space to sit or hang out and i thought	1
ok , i 'm torn on this one . i 've mentioned in my other reviews , i understand sometimes , people have bad days . so while the service was not so great , the food was ! and i love this place , i 'm not gon na	2
i disagree that this place is average . well not the menu anyway . i was really impressed . definitely not average bar food . the atmosphere is decadent , yet relaxing and friendly . i went for lunch and i have also been at night . perfect location to	3

fast at lunch time that 's for sure . i had a thin crust tomato and basil , skimpy on the basil and was n't that hot but i was starving so it <unk> . my client had the meat <unk> pizza or something <unk> that , she loved it	2
i like the tempe location better but this one is good too ! the church pews do kick ass . favorite pasties : vegetarian balsamic mushroom with mozzerella , spinach , and a side of marinara . peppered steak , the blue cheese in it makes it ! and for	4
pink spot is a cute place . it 's lacking in variety of ice cream flavors though , they have more coffee options than ice cream . the ice cream is decent , but grocery store quality . my husband really liked the root beer ice cream . the prices	2
what time is it ? thank goodness i did n't have to actually ask an employee here , because i woulda been <unk> . i spent a total of about 30 minutes waiting for help with their <unk> shirts program . that 's how long it took me to find	1
nice restrooms . i really should say <unk> that i did n't eat anything here . so why do they deserve 5 stars ? because i want to give a huge shout out to my server -lrb- insert name here -rrb- . i had just come from eating apps at	4
yep , still darn good . we ordered take out this week and it was just as good as always . i wish that i had a chen & wok in my hood in chicago . why is their lo mein so much better than everywhere else ?	3

ticoz is very close to a 5 in my book , which is tough because i am a picky , whining vegan -lrb- well at least that is the stereotype i am trying to live up to -rrb- . they have quite a few vegetarian options that can be made	3

so convenient , i 'm in love with their salad bar ! i also love that they list all of their ingredients in everything so that i know what i 'm getting , they also point out allergens in their food . i eat here about once a week ,	4
good for a fast healthy option that is reasonable priced , although you have to know what to order . i really like their tabouli , tossed greek salad and roll up entrees . everything else i 've tried has not been so great , the chicken is always overcooked	2

everything tastes delicious , i ca n't deny this . it 's expensive for a lunch though ... i do n't think i have left without spending at least $ 12-15 but i guess it 's to be expected in scottsdale quarter ! i 've always gone during weekday lunch	3

if the biggest coffee geek on the planet had a basement to himself , this is what he would create -- a lab , indeed . the coffee experts can get their rocks off on all the high tech brewing equipment , and the <unk> coffee , and food pairings	3
in my eyes , china chan is completely redeemed . apparently , i suck at picking dim sum dishes - except for the last time . i ordered the fried taro , the baked bbq beef buns , and the chinese broccoli . the fried taro were fluffy , crispy	3
at last , a sushi bar that is n't a hot spot , and is n't completely devoid of atmosphere . it is the perfect balance -- clean , but comfortable , sophisticated , yet friendly . what 's more , the food is excellent . i have been there	4

maybe it was the time that i caught this place but the less people the better for me . i just visited for the first time last night and i 'm hooked . for the off cue nights where i want to snack on some brats and beer sold !!!!	4
i like to think of green as the fast food for the <unk> challenged . whether you 're allergic to something , ca n't tolerate the taste of a particular item , curious of the spectrum of the v 's world , drop by this hidden niche . it 's	3
i 've been to this location several times but i 'd rather be more positive than <unk> . the service has always been a bit slow and less informative . i 've come in and on several occasions lost out on the specials till the very end when the server	2
food and service were amazing . we had the <unk> and brussel sprout flat bread and the smoked salmon scramble . service was right on with the <unk> and <unk> that we had everything we needed without bothering our conversation or meal . i love the decor and open feel	4
how does one write a review for an institution like trader joe 's ? i feel like everything has been said already -- but i 'll try to give you a fresh perspective . this is somewhere you can go for your staples and for exotic things to spice up	4
simply amazing ! $ 4.00 <unk> draft beers and delicious desserts rounded out an absolutely fantastic meal . we had shrimp ceviche . shrimp and fish tacos , and the shrimp <unk> . the shrimp ceviche had delicious spices , wonderful chunks of delicious goodness , and was definitely a	3
good food , nice decor . there 's really nothing wrong with wildflower that keeps it from 4 stars except the feeling that a good , but not orgasmic , take-out sandwich and 1/3 cup of potato salad -lrb- exactly 1/3 of a cup -rrb- should not cost $ 8.50	2
i 'm sad to say that the last few times we 've gone to `` the wood '' we 've been disappointed . the service has slipped to a level that none of us are willing to accept , and the attitude there seems to be <unk> an over 50	2

hidden inside of several other office building , this location can be easily overlooked . however , it was obvious from the number of cars at 6 p.m. on a weekday , that this place is a local hot spot despite its hidden venue . there was a visible line	4

obviously the reputation <unk> itself . the restaurant earned that reputation though . the pizza is fantastic . with their being open for lunch now and adding a second location , you can actually get one of those pizzas in less than 3 hours too , which is a bonus	3
i enjoy <unk> . it 's a dive but it 's a comfortable dive . the food is decent , the live music is always enjoyable , and the daily specials are a staple . the happy hour is 3-7 daily and there are reverse specials as well .	3
best ice cream in town , the kitchen sink sundae was phenomenal . the staff is so energetic and have so much pride in their products . be careful as this place is habit forming ! : -rrb-	4

totally average experience , the only saving grace was the soup . the buffet had a bunch of wilted lettuce with soggy croutons when we went there for dinner . they did have croutons separately towards the end of the counter , so i did n't understand why they had	1

the pesto was lacking flavor . i was really hoping they would live up to their name , but highly disappointed . their pasta was good though as well as their pie .	1
seems reviews are on 2 sides . we got groupon that included ticket and a soda . the regular prices are same as most cinemas . the extra here is what you can drink -lrb- alcohol -rrb- or eat -lrb- bar food -rrb- . for the ticket price and the	3

i just stopped for a `` wurst '' and that 's what i had . plain and simple . maybe i 'm spoiled by ted 's ... but this was just ok to calm the noon <unk> . being inside asu campus , there are not many offers , so	2

great selection and goooood flavor . this place is a cozy spot to try and enjoy a good gelato . i tend to have the chocolate flavors , and they had at least 3 different kinds . you wo n't believe this place has something sweet for you , so	4

this place is always crowded as many work or just waste <unk> using fb here . you might have trouble finding a space to sit , enjoy their coffee or tea and talk . decoration makes it very comfortable and the barista that day was a star ! my friend	3

for somebody who likes to try `` weird '' things , this is the perfect place . i even found white big corn -lrb- from peru -rrb- !!! i would buy more of their fresh vegetables , but i have to write down the names and find out some recipes	4
do n't bother . it might be in the `` exclusive '' area , but the service , drinks do n't match the location . i came here for an 80 's party and only one bar was working ... with one person . so the guy handled better with	1

heard about this restaurant from a friend and decided to take a co-worker who is relocating to another office out of town . and i am glad i chose this place . the service was a little slow out of the gate , hence the 4 star rating , but	3
i will premise this review by noting that there were only 2 other people in the place when i arrived . and that is the only reason that i did not give it 5 stars , becasue i would like to see how everything is when they are busier .	3
this place rocks . awesome tacos and a variety of meats to choose from . very affordable . the owner is very nice , everything is excellent .	3
solid four stars . very nice array of lines to climb , open , friendly , spacious . though i considered giving this a 3 because their <unk> area leaves a lot to be desired , small , cramped , short , and just overall not very good . but	3
really like this restaurant . i 've only been once , so i ca n't tell if its because i loved the feel of it or for the food . the pasta was homemade and i remember it feeling a little heavy and <unk> , but overall a nice date	2
this place is so overrated . everyone always raves about the authenticity of this restaurant and that its a phoenix gem - far from it . i 'm okay with the orange vinyl seats and the 70s vibe - no problem , you do n't have to be fancy to	1
during the spring and fall in phoenix , i 'm a huge fan of olive & ivy . you ca n't beat their patio - its first come , first served on huge , comfortable furniture along with fire pits . the areas are nicely divided and its absolutely perfect	3
i really , really , really like switch . in fact , i 'd give it a 4.5 if i could . my only wish is that the patio was a little more comfortable but the inside makes up for it . i prefer switch for lunch over dinner but	3
okay , so if you 're looking for a real sports bar in arcadia you 've found it . it 's totally a man 's bar and one of those places you feel silly ordering a martini or glass of wine but that 's what is great about it .	3

if there 's a place in old town that you can rely on for quality in food and service , this is the place . you get what you paid for . based on my last few visits , it seems to always be busy , which as you know	3
first off , was here one time on a friday evening and noticeably , the patrons are not your typical scottsdale social lite , was more like your tempe college crowd . but that 's ok , i came for the food ! so this place is not too bad	3
this is a pretty hip , trendy venue situated around the kierland area . the decor inside and out is very upscale and modern , similar to many places around scottsdale . the square <unk> of this place is very roomy , even on a good night with some outside	3

horrible , horrible , horrible , service . our waitress did n't do anything . another waitress took down and brought our drinks , took our order and a different waiter brought us our food . if it had been busy , i would n't be so harsh . it	0
i went in not even knowing what drink i had from yardhouse and even with my vague description this staff member , scott , was so smart and patient with me that he figured it out ! he actually even improved the drink with another recommendation ! they all have	4
unfortunately i will no longer be recommending loving hut . is it because the food tastes like crap ? no . is it due to weird hours of business or bad service ? no . it 's because it 's just too expensive now . bordering on a complete rip-off	1
went in today and got the golden vermicelli . same great taste , same store and same service , but that dish cost me $ <unk> . my older copy of the take-out menu here at work shows it as $ <unk> which imo was already on the upper end	3

this place is a hoot ! a friend wanted to go to a movie that had been out for a while and it turned out that it was only still playing at this theater and one other . this is typically a $ 3 theater , we happened to go	2
this is another one of those cases where the quality of the food does n't quite meet the quality of the service . we loved the food ! my lamb shank was tender and the barley gravy perfectly done . our waiter just seemed to be a tad off .	3
at the end of a long day , this was the perfect resting spot ! we grabbed a table outside so we could watch the central ave <unk> while sipping our tasty happy hour drinks . our waitress , tia , was the best . being on a restricted diet	4
the best fried chicken and waffles ever ! i think subconsciously you feel less guilty if you order the fried chicken breast but it was awesome . we all split sides of mac n cheese and collard greens . friendly , attentive staff . ca n't wait to go again	3

good , but nothing really outstanding . service is friendly and attentive here . the salsa has quite a kick . i ordered the seafood enchiladas . good flavor , wish they had a bit more of a cream sauce or something . unfortunately , they did a number on	2
good food , pass on the staff attitude . we ordered the chicago stuffed pizza on sunday evening . the waiter pushed us to order an appetizer or salad and this was after we asked for suggestions on the 10 or 12 inches . after suggesting what size he thought	2

perfect greek quick food place . staff is very friendly and portions are quite large for the money . my only <unk> is that the gyro meat needs a bit more flavor , but then again , maybe i just need to add tzatziki sauce . they also offer various	3

i got ta say this was a very pleasant surprise . i am generally turned off by places that seem to cater to an upscale crowd and was very hesitant to try this place . as we pulled into the parking that was almost soley devoted to valet , my	3
