You will not go wrong by buying tickets to this venue .	1
: )	1
The two people who simply wanted the meat course were left waiting , while the rest of the tasting party caught up to this course , until 1130p for their perfectly cooked rack of lamb !	1
It 's always a dilemma finding a good dry cleaners , since the quality varies so much .	1
A small place but the chicken and waffles are definitely great !	1
Not sure what some of the other Vegas pool parties are like ... but it will be hard to top the fun we had here !	1

Some pieces are reasonable .	1
Very talented .	1
If i could give a minus 5 stars I would .	0
I always tend to have the Salciccia sandwich which is sausage , onions , peppers and mozzarella cheese with a great house salad .	1
The chefs were very efficient and friendly .	1
The starters are delicious and usually change with the season 's ( I believe ) .	1
I just do n't have anything negative to say about them .	1
Every time I 'm in Vegas this is a must to see Andrea for a massage !	1
Douglas and his staff were kind and extremely helpful in getting my car repaired and back to me in no time .	1
Service was perfect , I 'm sorry I ca n't remember our servers name , but she was very nice , congenial and prompt .	1
I realize that dealerships can bring out the worst in people but if you open your eyes , realize they are a business and you do n't act like a total tool , you will be pleasantly surprised !	1
It is a little on the pricier side hence why I deducted a star but otherwise it 's a ( usually ) quiet and nice place to do laundry .	1
Highly recommend whether you 're a gym go-er or not !	1
You rarely see such an eclectic mix of people , from every color of the rainbow , and all ages , just enjoying the music .	1
So thankful for their help .	1
But whichever set up they have , the food is still tasty good .	1
Do n't even get me started on dessert , homemade rose sorbet made with real rose and chocolate ganache .	1
I was pleasantly suprised by the variety of vegetables that were all prepared so differently .	1
My brother had the lobster risotto and I had to taste it but I am glad I did ; may be the most delicious thing I have ever tasted .	1
Granted my daughter loved it & the pancake was bigger than her head ( she 's 3 lol ) .	1
The interior is a warm and comfortable place to sit , and I have noticed that they often have acoustic music on the weekend evenings .	0
She shared interesting facts about the desert plants , animals , and terrain .	1
We choose Flo 's in Tempe because an individual recommend it said he goes there for lunch all the time and said it 's fantastic .	0
This place has everything a classic bar should have , and it does n't pretend to be anything else - which is why I love it .	1
I have to really try not to laugh when inside The Evening Muse ( WHICH MAKES ME WANT TO REALLY LAUGH ) I think this is probably a really great place for a lot of people .	1
Such a talented artist !	1
It was delicious and the owner was such a cool guy .	1
I absolutely recommend this place .	1
But if you do n't mind driving a bit for meals and want to get away from it all without going too far away , this is a great option .	1
It 's the beautifully designed restaurant , the delicious cocktails , the attentive ( and good looking ) waitstaff , and being a part of the lively scene they 've created .	1
And this is coming from my somewhat picky vegetarian girlfriend , she was a fan of the tofu wings so dig in !	1
I 've only tried their breakfast menu and the portions are huge and delicious .	1

Great service from Lindsey !	1
Great local spot !	1
Definitely has one of the best chicken strips out there and their mac & cheese was to die for : ) You can pick a sauce of your choice but I would definitely recommend the wasabi cream ( if you have no problem with wasabi ) .	1
I personally did not really know what to expect from this store but I really enjoyed it .	1
Thank you so much Kristina Cervone .	1
The area is pretty open and you can see all the extra trails others have made , despite the `` keep off for revegetation '' signs .	0
I found it to be the perfect balance of the rich Montreal smoked meat and the tanginess of the mustard and sour pickle , albeit I prefer my food slightly more tangy than most people I 've noticed .	1
It 's perfect when you do n't feel like cooking , and when you feel like a drink - whether that 's coffee in the morning or something appropriate to late afternoon .	1
We came at a very odd , non busy hour and the staff was super friendly and attentive .	1
We really enjoyed the fried green tomatoes and our Po ' Boys -- better than what I had last time I was in New Orleans !	1
Everything else on the menu is absolutely amazing , but those 2 appetizers are a must have everytime my Wife and I come to Angelina 's .	1
Both were great guys to work with .	1
Angelo 's has the best pizza in town .	1
There 's also plenty parking so you 're good .	1
Although I have been a member for 3 years and attend 7 classes a week , each class is still unique and challenging .	1
Since last year , they 've added a fresh coat of paint to the place , brightened it up and added a few more items to the freezer of exotic meats .	1
Scott is friendly , and knowledgeable .	1
Love the Lamar !	1
I 'm from California , and there 's a ton of Hawaiian BBQ places there , and I can honestly say that your place .	1
It was very reassuring having them on my side and communicating with my insurance and the other side .	1
Everything taste delicious especially the orange juice .	1
The pizza had a nice thin crust we got a 12 inch with like 5 toppings and 2 cokes it came up to 28 $ it was so worth it !	1
Ca n't beat that .	1
Fast service and the portions are quite generous .	1
Anyways to wrap things up this park is definitely a good place to come on a nice day to get out and make the most of the weather .	1
Super cool !	1
It 's easy to order and the service is friendly and quick .	1
Roy ( behind the bar ) is awesome ! !	1
The chef for the teppanyaki table was fun and definitely entertaining .	1
Michael made sure the process of getting my car repaired went fast and painless .	1
Sure there are n't many famous franchised coffee shops like Intelligentsia Coffee and Stumptown Coffee in Las Vegas , but you can still find some high quality coffee shops like Desert Wind Coffee Roasters in the middle of this dessert-like environment .	1
Love Salty 's !	1
This store always has the best selections .	1
In the front of the house !	0
The bread that we were given initially was tasty too .	0
A wonderfully place to have lunch .	1
The chowder could have been spicier - but I love me some heat .	1
I have n't tried any other services with her but I 'm excited to !	1
There 's onion rings too !	1
Everything ordered were delicious !	1
Very friendly place that I will definitely revisit !	1
Fabulous small plates !	1
Paired with a good beer , you really ca n't go wrong with any of the burgers .	1
The design he presented was perfect and completed promptly .	1
This was one of the most amazing resorts I 've ever been to .	1

She is absolutely caring and wonderful .	0
I was immediately hooked .	1
EVERYTHING was filled to the perfect lines ... all condiments you could think of were there and perfectly arranged .	1
I 'll def use ACA every time from now on : ) thanks Rick !	1
If you are looking for fresh , soft , doughy donuts in the GTA - look no further , this place is bomb !	1
Just fantastic people serving a surprising variety of phenomenal crepes in a cozy nook with elegant decor .	1
Once again a great visit to a partner location of heavenly delight , both locations are run by the same management/owner .	1
and the bartender was very friendly and funny , and also got us our drinks correctly and fast .	1
Great service guys ... keep it up !	1
I 'll be back next Monday !	1
The horseradish creme fraische was sublime .	1
I 've referred multiple friends to her they had n't waxed before and now they are hooked !	1
You should definitely try Michael Angelo 's for a sweet treat for your next special occasion .	1
They are always very friendly .	1
Seriously the best sandwiches and softest bread ever .	1
The veggie burger and the Californication both are winners ..	1
The best part of this restaurant is the cool and modern ambiance with lots of warmth ( nice subway tiles everywhere and neon signs ) .	1
On two consecutive weekends , I needed to rent a truck , and both times , the service was excellent .	1
Also , the new decor/style is very nice , and the serve yourself/pay by weight model is great !	1
Once inside you 'll find 3 giant boards on the wall , labelled cone sizes and types , dips , and toppings galore .	1
Jason is the best in Henderson NV !	1
You are the perfect example of excellent customer service .	1
Very cool and modern building , awesome location and I like the fact that its a pet-friendly environment .	0

Excellent service .	1
The atmosphere is comfortable relaxing	1
Fish tacos were amazing , the fish it 's self was cooked perfect , moist and flaky !	1
The food is off the charts delicious .	1
Their prices are very reasonable and they do n't try to rip you off with services you do n't need .	1
The cheese flavour definitely comes through .	1
Met a friend for lunch , shared the tator tots , which were pleasantly not what we expected , way better than imagined .	1
Every time I go here I feel like I find new treasures that I would love to display all over the house .	1
Score clothes here too for the whole family .	1
We were constantly checked on , got our beers , appetizer , and dinners very quick , and everything was delicious ! ! !	1
The prices are a little pricer than the other Vietnamese sandwich shops BUT it 's all worth it !	1
All the meat came out promptly and the staff was easy to talk to and very attentive .	1
I have had many amazing cheese calzones in my life .	0
I generally prefer a more `` New Mexican '' taste with a bit more spice but once in awhile it 's good to eat food that while very flavorful I it 's own right , is not super spicy .	1
The way I wanted it done-directly through my lip , which is different from the traditional , inverted labret- was no problem and the piercer , Jimmy , took his time locating the exact bar I needed .	1
Even though it gets really crowded the service is pretty fast !	1
I really wish they offered more than 6 choices though !	1
The vibe is great , the cider is delicious , and I enjoy the local food truck options they rotate through .	1
They play fun music at a good volume level .	1
I will recommend you to all my friends : ) .	1
Excellent customer service !	1
Hi apprentice was cool too !	1
The guy who did my tattoos was very personable and made sure i was happy with my tattoo placement and that i wasnt in any pain .	1
Great vibes and music .	1
Always great choice for breakfast lunch or dinner !	1
Even though the Nugget touts its pool as the gem of downtown , the lounge area is way too small for the number of people who use it , even on a Friday or Monday .	1
She manhandled my feet and I am so grateful .	1
10/10	1
I will definitely be going back .	1
I have always been greeted , served and helped by attentive and knowledgable workers at Z .	1
This by far the most unique and arguably the best place in Vegas !	1
I 'd definitely stay here again .	1
One of the best pizzas I 've ever had - they use a distinct sour dough ( not sure if that 's actually what it is , but that 's what it tastes like ) crust that 's right in-between crunchy flat crust and fluffy regular pizza .	1
The music was very relaxing and calming .	1
I love the bacon and tomato skewer , really nice combination , the fresh taste of the tomato can take out the greasy taste of the bacon !	1
Great quality cuts for the sushi , which is pretty much the only thing I order here .	1
He 's smart , very easy to speak with , and completed the work with great efficiency .	1
From the moment he introduced himself to the moment I walked out the door he did everything possible to make me feel comfortable and to make sure my needs were met .	1
It 's cozy and I like the feeling of being tucked away in my own little alcove .	1
This show is a masterpiece ... enuf said .	1
We then went on to the cocktail bar , the drinks where great , it 's hard to describe just go !	1
David managed to line up a number of excellent options and was able to quickly adjust as we refined our requirements .	1
Long waits usually but so worth it .	1
They had many beautiful purses and shoes to die for .	1
But so glad i made it .	1
He also reassured me that , despite a previous dentist from hell 's assessment that my daughter ( who was three at the time - THREE ! )	1
Great staff !	1
That thing was delightful .	1
It could have been a disaster but I ended up enjoying my side trip to Vegas !	1
And that was the best decision ever .	1
They were amazing .	1
Service is great and I love the food .	1
It felt like you were at a BAD FAMILY PICNIC ! !	0

I am continuously being complimented on my sleeve .	1
Now today I ordered take out I got the leg & thigh tender and juicy as I remembered .	1
The staff is very helpful and knowledgable .	1
Wonderful slaw and I love it .	0
Their thin crust is also good .	1
The orphan basket near the register is also awesome -- tiny cuttings of cheese to increase variety on your cheeseboard without leftovers !	1
The staff were so knowledgeable about coffee and seemed very passionate .	1
Anyways , you can find everything you would ever need to go fishing here , I have never seen so many reels in one place at one time !	1
I have some horror stories of doctors that I somehow wound up seeing , and one or two I was truly blessed to find , and I 'm happy to report that she is one of those .	1
They came with different types of jams and Devonshire cream which were a great complement to the warm , flakiness of the scones .	1
They do n't have too much to offer for food and the drink list was not very impressive , so I just ordered a vodka cranberry -- ca n't really go wrong with that .	0
A pleasant surprise !	1
Beer and wine served here too - buzz bonus !	1
HAHA !	1
I 'm not a fan of any ice cream but there iceys I love .	0
I 'm giving this place a solid 5 stars .	1

I should 've taken her up on it cuz the pineapple/coconut slaw sounded and looked amazing , same with the chicken salad I ordered the pastrami sandwich with sidewinder fries which was so tasty !	1

Plenty of parking , nice shopping area too .	1
I 'd recommend this as a good place to go after work for drinks with your colleagues .	1
There 's a good amount of old vintage machines , dating back to the 1960 's and 1970 's that have little excerpts about them , making them fun to read .	1

Also , their cinnamon rolls are outstanding ; large and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness .	1
Food is fresh and very tasty .	1
And their daily fresh juice is the killer .	1

My country fried steak was absolutely delicious and the Mexican omelette was very flavorful and tasty .	1
we only buy a couple of things , but it 's just fun to be out and about with the dog and enjoying our great weather .	1

The receptionist quickly helped me and assigned Lisa to show me to the lower level .	1

Our favourite was the fried squid ; lightly battered with subtle seasoning .	1
After reading the menu that was filled with delicious looking items , I settled on the Beef and Chicken Satay as it was the namesake of the restaurant after all .	1

You wo n't be disappointed .	1
The garlic/onions did n't overpower the duck but gave the dish an delicious savory flavor .	1
are served in a big flat pan over a portable gas burner - so it required a little bit of eater participation !	1
My son loves his weekly gymboree time !	1
And what 's even better - and this is HUGE for me - the shop occupies a large space , with big tables spread out far enough for privacy , and lets a lot of sunlight in .	1
All in all , we 'll still be coming back , just note that you 'd most likely spend around $ 25-60 , depending on what you get , and how many people are with you .	1
Simply wonderful .	1

and the calamari were still hot ; I 've had better squid but theirs was nicely seasoned and plentiful .	1

The food was excellent !	1
When we mentioned it was her birthday , they gave us complimentary dessert , which was a great touch .	1
Even the decor was a very pleasant surprise from a normal strip-mall restaurant ... tile floors with a variation between glossy and matte , lots of glossy wood , and chairs and booths that combined wood with black leather-like material .	1
I plan to visit again soon .	1
What is really nice is that you are able to have half portions of the pasta , which is still plenty for one person .	1

I love peach and this Peach drink was very refreshing .	1

The first Noodle Pot is on Spring Mountain and this one is rightfully located on Eastern in Henderson .	1

The chashu was slow-cooked and then finished on the grill , which gave it a very good smokey flavor , although it might have benefited from a stronger marinade .	1
And then there was the dessert , courtesy of a Cordon Bleu student serving an externship at the restaurant , an excellent , moist , rich chocolate-chocolate cream , chocolate frosted cake drizzled with what I think was a raspberry sauce , artfully served even in the take-out box .	1
Cheers !	1
Fluffy , warm and perfectly toasted pita bread .	1
I plan to go back soon !	1
Ms. Sheri and Ms. Nikki are wonderful !	1
In love with my hair done by Kayla !	1

I had the mutton chop , which was fantastic .	1
Obligatory Title Pun : WAFL-copters !	1
An afternoon Father Day 's lunch turned into a delicious stuffed burger endeavor which resulted in a full stomach and a pile of napkins the size of a small brush pile .	1

The address on Yelp is the address for Squirrel Lake Park , which is probably the best place to park .	1
Basset brunch club is one of my favorite places to go for hungover breakfast with friends .	1

Mike and his son did a fantastic job on my carpet .	1
It 's a really good price for fresh fish .	1

Working in the Bloor/Dufferin area , it has been hard to find a perfect after-work place to get a cold beer and something good to eat .	1
The only downside is the price ( I think it was $ 9.89 the last time I went for lunch ) so be prepared to shell out some money for a nice salad lunch .	1
YUM !	1

This place is AWESOME ! ! !	1
Very creamy and comforting .	1
Great salt water aquarium too ... beautiful .	1

The thing is most CrossFit boxes do n't welcome every walk of life , every body type , every level of fitness , every health challenge , and every age group .	1
A & W is above the rest when it comes to fast food .	1
David , the director of sales and catering , was a superstar !	1
All washed down with $ 2 sake , you ca n't go wrong !	1
We also got seated pretty quickly near the front of the buffet next to the desserts .	1
Through my typical dumb luck , which I am blessed to have in spades , I was able to get tickets to a show on this particular night that I needed them .	1

The bottom layer is a brownie , over that was a vanilla mousse-like layer , and over that was their signature salted caramel brownie .	1
She 's the best !	1
It 's a good thing that I live over 2 hours away from here , because the ability to get an amazing pastry 24/7 is a temptation that I would fall for way too often .	1
The service is top notch !	1

it 's a bit stressful not knowing if your stylist will be there for your next cut : p for example , my latest stylist Chicari ( sp ? )	1
I 'd write more , but every time I eat here , I slip into food coma ... PS : As with all Cosmopolitan locations , I feel compelled to add full disclosure : I work at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas , where Wicked Spoon is located .	1
But overall , I enjoyed my dinner , and the waiters were extremely attentive and efficient .	1
I would highly recommend this company to everyone .	1

Also the best mana pua , spam musubi , oriental chicken salad .. Just go already , you 're tummy will be happy : )	1
So last I 've gotten my ac fixed and it 's been fine till tonight , also the service that they have provided me was awesome last year !	1
They had a live Chinese singer that was fabulous and the vibe was much more engaging and lively than your typical Chinese food restaurant .	1
Fresh and clean tasting , not heavy at all .	1
Adrienne is excellent ...	1
unexpectedly nice sushi place right next to carlton cinema .	1
They have a slightly `` chewy '' crust with great toppings and at a very fair price .	1
All of it was very delicious !	1
The key to the pumpkin is that it adds a nice flavor and a little sweetness , this goes great with their homemade sauce - watch out the sauce packs a serious punch .	1
The bone marrow was to die for .	1
My dish was very flavorful and the recommendation of the server was to eat the dumpling with the sauce .	1
Overall a really good deal .	0
Our upgrade was to a Mediterranean Suite , and the cost was very reasonable , but that was based on the time of year , the weekend before Christmas .	1
Thanks Layla !	1

My guy got the Italian Burger w/ marinara sauce & a bunch of other yummies , pancetta , mozzarella & garlic aioli .	1
My only complaint is their attitude was very much `` done this a thousand times '' instead of a compassionate understanding that the parents have n't seen this before and are concerned .	1
Not to mention , we discovered that they make some of the very best cocktails in Cleveland or anywhere .	0
Buns are on the pricier end , but also definitely super filling , pineapple bun and St. Germain bun are great .	1

Satay Thai Bistro is going for the tapas bar environment , so it feels a little weird eating there without ordering a lot of small dishes ( tapas-like ) or drinking alcohol .	1
but you know when you find that special person that makes you feel flawless , it 's the greatest accomplishment !	1
Italian beef and sausage combo was bomb .	1
Legion is one of those places that feels like it 's off the beaten path , yet it 's only a short walk from Lakeshore Road .	1

2 hours before close ( usually 9pm on weekdays or 11pm on weekends ) they have buck-a-shuck oysters .	1
My only dislike was their style of fries/ hash browns .	1
Plenty of places to sit , especially since they have a nice patio for al fresco dining ... and do n't forget to serve yourself with the peanuts in the shell to munch on while waiting for your number to be called .	1
The recommendations for Dr Bracken were terrific but he is SOOOOO much better than you could even imagine .	1

I would recommend this restaurant and I am definitely going again !	1
Amazing customer service , really good steak and the best sweet potato casserole you could ever imagine .	1
The building has been here since before just about anything else in Vegas -- 1906 , so the strange familiarity and comfort start a creative soul to fantasize of sordid misadventures held here in a past life , perhaps a roaring 20 's soiree or a post-WWII survival celebration .	1
Also very good .	1
The cut is paired with a creamed horseradish .	1
Definitely a place to stop by and enjoy the food .	1
Customer service has been excellent every time I have called , and they always read my order back to ensure that they have everything right .	1

We have dined here numerous times and truly enjoy it .	1

BUT juriah ( the counter agent ) saved the day !	1
Our driver , Carol was very professional and at the same time , friendly and helpful .	1
It 's a great starting point or even a great place to unwind after a wild night of partying .	1
Super sweet of them and the noodles were yummy as usual .	1
Bonus on Tuesday - trivia night !	1
They have amazing curries here and the variety of options is nuts .	1

Since it 's built into downtown it 's very easy to navigate if you know how to read a street sign .	1
It adds so much to the meal to have great service .....	1
The only negative is that it is ALWAYS packed !	1
The price point is exceptional as well , as similar car wash places easily charge at least $ 10 more for the same or lesser work .	1
Everyone here is friendly and nice .	1

It 's an aveda salon and it has very reasonable prices for cuts and colors .	1

All I can say is you need to experience this place for yourself to enjoy the diverse palate of flavors and fusion !	1

I love their unisex bathroom/public sink mode .	1
Ambiance is nice & classy , service is good , but prices are a little higher than other pizza places .	1

She is SUPER responsive and very sweet .	1
It 's filling , tasty and cheap !	1

One of the best Mani-Pedi 's I 've ever had .	1
I highly recommend them !	1
It was creamy , flavorful and mind-blowing .	1
Most of the time , things go very smoothly .	1
The combo of great food paired up with outstanding service !	1
everyday they have a specials menu which in my opinion is the menu to eat from once .	1
Levi also installed a keypad for our front door , that works great and is so useful !	1
They finished in about 3 or 4 hours and he looks amazing .	1
One of the best hair cuts I ever got !	1
My first ever review on Yelp ... not something I usually do but wanted others to know about Andrea and how I 'm glad I found her since moving to Henderson .	1
We ate Greek food , they also have Italian .	1
Anyway , just food , just booze , or both ... you 'll have a great time .	1
I especially love to pick up the kimbab , which is among the tastiest .	1
You 're welcome !	1
Every restaurant I ordered from the app , the restaurant was able to identify my order by my name and really aim to make sure my experience was good .	0
I appreciate the low wait times and friendly staff- shows respect to you as a patient .	1

It 's much more delicious that way , when you 're not overwhelmed by veggies .	1
Their banana nut bread was amazing .	1
The staff was attentive and polite .	1
But otherwise , delish !	1
They limit 2 plates of Uni per person , I think , but the quality of their seafood is really fresh .	1

The cons of why I did n't give it 5 stars .	1
I 'll be coming back !	1

Very good food , of course I had a salad pita with fries but it was delicious especially the dressing and cheese they put on it .	1
And the service was very fast and friendly ...	1
This is my favorite place to eat in downtown toronto .	1
The best Indian food Madison has to offer , for sure .	1
I had to stop by Garrett Popcorn Shops after reading a tip from a Yelper saying that Garrett Popcorn Shops is popular in Chicago .	1
The food is always perfect , the service is outstanding , great ambience .... I appreciate that th servers make suggestions and very friendly .	1
If you go with the Chicken Fried Rice , you wo n't be disappointed - but you may not be blown away .	1
I love that they have a whole menu section for naan .	1

I will definitely go again !	1
If you are a fan of eggs benedict I would recommend this dish .	1
Tony and his crew completed the job in the timeframe they outlined .	1
Cody and Janna ( co owners ) are welcoming and super friendly .	1
Cirque Du Soileil , Le Reve , Jersey Boys , stand up comedy shows , variety acts , magic acts , and the list goes on and on !	1
Talk about an incredible food explosion in your mouth !	1
The other thing I like about this place is if you do n't feel like having one of their signature sandwiches , you can create your own .	1
I will definitely go back !	1
I had a kobe beef carpaccio appetizer that was absolutely delicious -- it had great Asian flavors and was mouth-meltingly delectable .	1
My favorites so far are one of the specials with white chocolate and dried cranberries and the Nutty Pig ( I picked one with just a bit of blue cheese ) .	1
Chestnut Gnocchi with Vanilla-infused cherry tomato - The gnocchi for me was a bit starchy - not sure if it is because of the way they are shaped ( thick , round slices ) .	1
I would recommend this place to anyone .	1
Mike P was awesome , he helped us from start to finish , realize the vision we had and moved plants and flowers all around until we were satisfied with the look .	1
Markham brunch fans rejoice !	1
Very attentive to check when you 're finished your dish so that they can clear it straightaway .	1
Thanks , Courtesy Chevrolet !	0
Joe went above and beyond the canned MLS searches to identify prospective homes that specifically fit our needs .	1
They also have happy hour app and drink specials that I 'd be very interested in coming back to check out !	1
I will definatly be going back : ) The prices are ap affordable and everyone was very friendly !	1
if you are visiting from out of town or are looking for a place to bring out of town visitors , conspire is definitely particular to phoenix ( in the best way ) .	1
i saw some tables eating oysters ( $ 2 each i think ) , we had the calamari which was nicely fried but the sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking .	1
The meats are great to take home for some BBQ or just have them grill the meat for only $ 1 more a pound .	1
Heavenly .	1
Looking trendy and posh is n't going to cut it anymore when the sushi scene has become so big and competitive in Toronto .	0
Great experience !	1
This place is really awesome !	1
Found Kelly ( owner of Reprise Hair Studio , on State Street , 26 years of experience , and only charges $ 40 for woman 's cuts ) who nailed the cut on the first try , w/ the exception of some layers which still need to grow out .	1
Totally worth the price of admission .	1
Love this restaurant !	1
They were offering a lobster bisque that day and I sampled it from one of my fellow diners and he would only let me have one bite although I wanted more , it was so good .	1
she had a fuji apple salad that was nice , light and refreshing .	1
It 's paired with a dipping sauce composed of fish sauce , garlic and chillies .	1
Joanna is innovative , and you can tell she loves what she does .	1
This deserves 5 stars all the way .	1
I was even able to get any size I wanted , yaaaayy ! ! ! !	1
Attended a wedding rehearsal dinner this past weekend @ Cornish Pasty Company and was very impressed .	1
What a great job ! ! ! !	1
We 'll be back for sure .	1
Other than that a solid place for steaks , souvlaki , and burgers !	1
I 'm obsessed with their alien burrito and caramel frappe ... seriously makes my day every time I come here .	1
However , having said that , I was extremely impressed with the quality of the food here .	1
dinner was so good we decided to have lunch on our last day as well !	1
Absolutely Amazing ! ! !	1
The meals come with salad and huge generous side of the best roasted red potatoes , rice or fries ) .	1
Great place to take the kids when it 's say ... raining out .	1
I had the Hollywood omelet with a fruit cup on the side and it was as expected , perfect .	1
Then we shared the Portland style lobster rolls with house cut fries .	1
Not only is Andrea great at what she does , she is a thoughtful and caring person ! )	1
Aron Alexis Chris Dan Dustin Kaitlyn Kalie Matt Nike Thank you !	1
I was pleasantly surprised as I had n't eaten here before even though living in the area for the past 15 years .	1
Ha , I liked this place !	1
We ended our meal with a root beer float !	1
We can not say enough for them !	1
( I usually judge a restaurant such as this by their chips and salsa ... ) I ended up having a salad with cheese and whatnot removed , and salsa for dressing , as most of the dressings also had dairy in them ...... Service was SUPERB !	1
I think these guys are very honest and they make sure that the customer is happy with the job .	1
Chips were good added some salt to them and on my beans I like spice so I used some of the diabalo sauce and it is REALLY HOT !	1
I 've been going for years , the friendliness & cleanliness is what keeps me coming back .	1
It tasted very much like home food : ) Suggestion : dollar idly could be served in a bigger bowl as it 's difficult to fit your spoon and eat !	1
Ensuite ça reste un casino IMMENSE avec une des plus grandes galleries marchandes de Vegas .	1
We did n't get a chance to stay and explore the town .	1
Our waitress was very attentive .	1
The braised short ribs and pork is amazing accompanied with the their margarita so delicious .	1
Definitely try the mulled wine if the line is not long !	0
Great family owned business .	1
Dine-in or take-out , this place is great .	1
Food made to order was hot and fresh !	1
I like the rueben , but it 's so hearty , I ca n't finish it all at once .	1
Overall this is a nice restaurant but do n't come in expecting it to taste authentic .	1
But surprisingly moist and they use real fresh fruits in making them .	1
Nice staff too !	1
Bubble time was awesome as well .	1
The homemade toasted marshmallows are to die for , I could eat them all day !	1
The ease of the check in process was greatly appreciated .	1
This is very beautiful hair salon , it has wonderful industrial look , high ceiling 's with huge ceiling fans , it is very clean and has plenty of day light .	1
I found some nice finds .	1
Meals also served with soup Will return !	1
Great experience , the store is neat and the employees are eager to help you and not be pushy and judge mental like at Sephora or MAC .	1
The seating is comfortable and the decor is light and happy feeling .	1
The drinks were stiff and service was great !	1
They 're great about socializing and their report cards are so cute !	1
Would definitely order again .	1
The line for the drive thru is always long at night , but it moves fairly quickly .	1

He was very patient with us and our teething baby .	1
It 's a loud place to have an intimate dinner .	1

Flatbreads are off the charts delicious with an ample amount of toppings .	1
Always satisfied with Adrians .	1
I ca n't wait to try more cocktails and other items on the menu soon !	1
We 've always had a great experience with their food , staff and drinks .	1
Very steaky-y tasting , juicy , flavorful meat .	1
Great crab leg selection .	1
If you like salty food and the taste of browning ( if you do n't know what browning is , you might love this food so go enjoy ! )	0
Sam was happy to make the appointment , took his time with me when I got there , and reinforced that I was making the right decision by walking me through the car 's features and pointing out small details .	1
This one was up to par and made the stay comfortable for us .	1
Finally found our future home ! ! !	1
Jenya was the absolute best !	1
Waiter was quick and attentive without being annoying .	1
It is your one stop shop for creating your own masterpiece in relaxed and welcoming environment .	1
The beef was tender and savory and I loved the selection of five BBQ sauces at the table .	1
The family that runs this establishment really cares about the quality of product they put out and the level of service .	1
Longboard Living has provided Toronto with HAND-Painted custom designed boards since 2008 .	1

Took my Mother for her birthday Saturday and Marc , our server was pretty spot on !	1
I wish Viva Las Arepas was closer to the locals , but I hear they 're opening a second location so there 's hope !	1
Very tasty Classic Italian food !	1
You can choose your own sides and they have yummy selections .	1
The vet was very informative and guided me step by step and gave me advice on his umbilical hernia which I will be getting him surgery for when he 's older ( it does n't bother him as of yet ) .	1
Really relaxing .	1
Give this place a try ... solid restaurant , with fantastic food and unique atmosphere .	1
Especially if you like maki like me , it 's worth the trip .	1
This is a Chinese Hawaiian fusion place serving up legit brewed tea boba drinks and Hawaiian comfort food .	1
The only real negative thing I can find to say is that the parking SUCKS- bring your hiking boots ( it 's not THAT BAD- I 've made it in heels- and sit there with my heels off under the table after I get there LOL )	1
Thank you universe for Dos Gringos .	1
The food is yum !	1
I commissioned a custom engagement ring design with Leif and he delivered amazing results .	1
I really love their rare cheesecake and other baked goods .	1
The pizza was really great -- it had a slight char to the thin crust , enough sauce and cheese , a great texture , and the flavor was there .	1
Beautiful bar and restaurant tucked away off Scottsdale road .	1
Normal prices would make it a little on the pricey side , but it was good food .	1
it a cute little cafe that most people come here to study for .	1
Best veggie falafel wrap !	1
Delicious !	1
Great sushi for a great price !	1
Their service is so professional and very helpful .	1

He has a wonderful bedside manner .	1
This is one of my fav dishes and I only managed one bite .	0
So Yay Belk !	1
I loved all of them .	1
I hope that tomorrow is just as great as our evening has been .	1
Sounds like a great date spot to me .	1
The breakfast tacos and H-Town are must tries !	1
The only fault I would find is that if you 're not a huge cheddar cheese fan , they cover most meals with a ton of it .	1
I would definitely come back and plan to !	1
My personal favorite : Keema Pav , Vada Pav , Biryani ( awesome presentation ) , lamb masala and definitely Pan Shot ! !	1
She was very complimentary of the staff , especially the therapy team .	1
Their pancakes , my favorite , are great !	1
Love this local joint .	1

I would n't hesitate to give them an A-ok 3 stars but considering the attentive service we consistently receive I am going to throw in an extra star .	1
This is one of my favorites places to have lunch in downtown , everything is fresh and delicious ! ..	1
Last time I was there I actually ate dinner for the first time and had a blackened shrimp/rice dish which was incredible ! !	1
They helped me out quickly when I was in a bind .	1
Everything tasted so fresh ; words can not describe !	1
I love the atmosphere here .	1
Great atmosphere and decor ( love the old music memorabilia ) .	1
The chicken was tender , the sandwich was tasty and the fries amazing ! !	1
It 's the best I 've ever had - not only in Phoenix , but ever ( this is saying a lot as I 've lived in NY and eaten a lot of spicy tuna in my day ) .	1
I was more than pleased about this particular event and think they deserve the 5 star review .	1
If you do ask nicely , you even get a private tour of the facilities and gets to taste a couple of beers ! ! !	1
Tried it for the first time ........ LOVED IT ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
I order a different sandwich each visit and have been amazed everytime .	1
Great food , reasonable prices and a free show makes this place # 1 on my list of places to frequent while in Vegas	1
Lots of selection and there 's something for everyone !	1
It looked like a huge tater tot but it was super yummy .	0
Definitely worth a trip .	1
Worth the drive even if you 're not in the neighborhood !	1
Awesome selection of cheese , sausages , wine and beer .	1
I really liked the patio ( 20 degrees and sunny outside , but I would have found it stuffy were I inside the actual restaurant ) Food Quality : 9/10 .	1
Absolutely the best fish tacos I 've ever had .	1
That was the only downside to our experience .	1
The greens are delicious and they have the best tea in town .	1
Indian food is always a favourite of mine so getting to try a new place is always a good thing for me .	1
Very cozy with a great vibe .	1

She takes as much time as is needed to get to the root of the problem and has recommended supplements that have really helped me .	1
I 'm certain Culinary Dropout has 5 Star potential , so I 'm really looking forward to returning .	1
At first glance it 's a bit pricey at $ 5 a scoop , but really that one scoop can feed two people because we ended up splitting it both times and it was more than enough .	1
They were all very tasty I thought the flavors were very good and unique .	1
They also use a lot of pepper which I 'm not personally a big fan of .	1
I would recommend putting it in the fridge for a bit before eating because it is soooooo soft we could n't pick it up !	1
The service is great and always friendly .	1
A HUGE thanks to everyone there today ( - :	1
Amazing .	1
Thank you , Michael !	1
I would highly recommend Retro Pro for your next remodeling project .	1
I got Ashley who is crazy but crazy good !	1
Huge selection of books at very competitive prices .	1
I ca n't wait to go back and try the dinner menu .	1
On a side note , the place is clean and well kept and the drinks are reasonable .	1
Décor is cozy .	1
So I really like how Just Rollin ' does up their tasty egg rolls !	1
My friend and I shared a plain croissant , a honey twist , an ' 8 ' and a Pistache .	1
My fav spot !	1
Tender meat , great flavor , not too salty .	1
Also serve beer which washes down a sandwich nicely !	1
And when they found out it was his bday , they even brought him out a little dessert .	1
It tends to be deader than dead so it feels like a private party .	1
I followed my stylist Abby Samerigo to Eddys - this place is the cutest !	1
Oh Toro , Chu Toro , Giant Clam , and Sweet Shrimp sushi - everything was amazingly fresh .	1
Their pastries also nicely top off the flavours ... On the brew side , if you are interested , try their special drip coffee , or go for your favourite drink at the barista machine .	1
It 's a great place for hw .	1
Best wings and fries ever .	1
Everyone working there was awesome this experience was top notch , we are even talking about doing it again , it was that good !	1
I also like that if you have a food allergy or want your dish cooked separate , it 's so easy to put a white stick in the bowl and not have to worry about getting surprise meat in your dish ( especially if you 're vegetarian/vegan )	1
Love going to this place !	1
Insomnia is my favourite spot in Toronto for martinis !	1
I recommend them to get hooked up	1
This husband and wife team provide an outstanding massage experience .	1
This is a great `` icebreaker '' and puts me at ease .	1
I find this a bit of healthier alternative if you replace it with meal !	1
JOHN was my therapist , and he is absolutely phenomenal !	1
The coffee is always great ... better than the competition , that is for sure ! !	1
Very cute genuine Italian restauran with a very intimate atmosphere great for a casual date .	1
It 's a little bit hidden as it 's off the main street .	1
There 's even a little labyrinth which is a cool touch .	1
Terry always responds the messages , his crew Adrienne and Mamba are good and professional .	1
We usually go to the one on the North Side ( their back yard area is adorable ! )	1
These sandwiches are tasty !	1
This place just has it all and is my new favorite spot for some comfort food that transports me right back to the warm fuzzies of childhood .	1
They are lucky to have him !	1
Lentil loaf did not disappoint either .	1
I tried the Japanese Lasagna roll and the Lisa Lisa roll and they were AMAZING !	1
The dough is nice and fluffy and the edges are perfectly crusty .	1
Spicy , full of flavor and the dough was seasoned which is hard to find .	1
The coils are top notch and the juice is fairly priced .	1
When you 're unsure about exactly what you want , Nancy has a special ability to find the perfect frames that you would n't have thought to look at !	1
The only complaint is the excessive use of styrofoam and plastic ware , but I guess that 's the nature of the take-out beast .	1
The place can be like a maze , so best to carry a map .	1
Id definitely stay here again though .	1
It was our 3rd time there and each time it was a unique and wonderful experience .	1
Ca n't wait to go back and see what other treats this gorgeous little tienda has to offer me .	1
Best boba I 've had in Arizona hands down .	1
The staff is super nice and helpful ( I have celiacs disease and they have gluten free soy sauce available ! )	1
The pita is light , fluffy , and fresh and delicious .	1
We would definitely stop here again we when visit Phoenix .	1
Armed to find something delicious , my friend and I set out westward on Queen , checking out the menus and came across Niche .	1
It is one of my favourite places to go for brunch , lunch and dinner in the beach area .	1
I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a great place to get ice cream and to hang out in a great environment !	1
The anti pasta bar was great as well , my favorite was the Caesar salad and the egg frittata .	1
Fresh ingredients and gi-gan-tic portions really make this pizza place rock !	1
Mercedes was our experience leader and she did a great job of ensuring we were well-prepared .	1
There is plenty of picnic tables and BBQ grills .	1
I would dream about those deep-dish slices and would often stop in when traveling through central Illinois .	1
They are definitely a great option for when you need a repair and do n't want to buy a new phone !	1
Everything is fresh , perfectly prepared , and beautifully presented .	1
The entire family loved it and for Tuesday night special , it was easy on the wallet .	1
Fresh ingredients and the presentation was wonderful .	1
I 've been 3 times now and the food is always excellent .	1
The food is absolutely delicious and by far my favorite part of the N9NE experience .	1
My recommendations would be the bun cha ha noi , which is a vermicelli meal that 's deconstructed with cuts of meat in fish sauce and fresh veggies/herbs , and the long doi , which is sausage but with intestines ( probably an acquired taste ) .	1
I took the easiest class that I thought first -- Ballet Barre .	1
The room/suite was amazing and huge , as was the bathroom , and the lounge area .	1
The staff is super friendly !	1
Food : lots of starters which we shared .. 12 salt and pepper wings , beer battered mushrooms with very tasty ginger sweet and sour , 2 orders of Poutine , and pizza rolls .. all very tasty and all reasonably priced .	1
All of the cupcakes I purchased were very delicious .	1
Which is no small feat considering how many people visit any given DMV field office a day !	1
I was surprised I ate the entire thing since it looks pretty big !	1
For it 's size , it punches well above it 's weight in terms of design , variety of service , and comfort .	1
It was the best Italian I have eaten .	1

When I came to them with two complicated projects , they guided me through the process with a great deal of patience and superb knowledge ... the result was nothing short of stunning .	1
This is my go to Mexican restaurant , the food is great and you ca n't beat the prices .	1

My cioppino was similarly delicious , cooked perfectly ( which can be hard to do with mixed seafood ) , great flavor to the broth .	1
Surprisingly tasty and reasonably priced .	1
I 'd say it was cooked to perfection .	1
Thank you for a beautiful job ! !	1
Like most breakfast spots in Charlotte , there can be a long wait for a table on the weekends .	1
They also have traditional burgers and sandwiches if seafood is not your thang .	1
We all tried different entres which were delicious .	1
We all love it !	1
Great food , great service .	1
The breads were so good we ordered a couple of loaves to take home with us .	1

Nevertheless , I would definitely go back .	1
I have had wonderful results and enjoy just being at the studio .	1
The staff were very friendly and attentive , and navigated the crowded dining room with ease .	0

We were unfortunate enough to be stuck in a hotel for two months and her business provided a great place to keep my little Westie Highland Terrier happy and healthy .	1
He is willing to help you out !	1
Did I mention we loved the cozy , homey not glitzy ambience .	1
It was a very easy process , made an appointment for an examination and they were able to get her in fairly quickly .	1
The only downside was that the mattress on the bed was too soft .	1
All in all it was the perfect balanced approach to getting myself on some kind of regular routine for taking care of my muscles , posture and well-being .	1
Every age , every ethnicity , etc just made it easy for anyone to feel comfortable .	1
Other noteworthy mentions include the spinach salad ( not healthy , fried spinach , but the texture of it is incredible ) and brussel sprouts .	1
We WILL Definately be back with our family to enjoy more of their delicious food .	1
Tried the regular margarita , the blueberry pomegranate margarita , the incommunicado , the tranquil waters -- when it comes to the drinks you ca n't go wrong .	1

The shape makes it really nice to customize as a half-and-half or to split with someone else .	1
Overall Quality- great Price-great Sales person ( Logan ) -great Options-large selection Time frame for ordering- average time to order and install .	1
If I 'm in the area again this is definitely a great place for Mexican food .	1
On the side , we also had Spicy Pork Wontons , which was a different take on wontons that I 've never had before , but it was so delicious .	1
So much fun !	1
Do n't miss their patio when the weather is good .	1
Drinks are moderately priced and excellent quality .	1
We loved their fresh vegetable juice blends .	1
Needless to say , my headshots from Bob are my most favorite photos I 've ever seen of myself .	1
If you live around Montréal or if you are visiting Montréal it 's a must try .	1
Even if you do n't buy anything it is a great place to get inspiration ( i need a farmhouse sink in my life ) .	1
Me , I loved the inferno .	1
My opinion is that this is a solid moving company that will take care of you .	1
I went that Saturday and bought my favorite - an apple fritter - and was pleased to find they did n't disappoint .	1
I got the Chow Mein and the Shrimp/Ham Fried Rice when I visited this awesome place !	1
They do have a tempura sauce station next to the drink station so do n't forget to get some dipping sauce for these delectable morsels .	1
The Classic Profiteroles were a perfect choice .	1
I 've came here twice and I absolutely adore this place .	1
We enjoyed a concert and a full day in their amazing spa .	1

Anyways , I highly suggest this place if your in the area .	1
I have noticed the therapeutic qualities associated with great Scenery .	1
Each bite brought in different elements of the dish , continually building on the sophisticated flavors ... and kept my taste buds intrigued .	1
It 's a great place to study , catch up with friends , or just want a great drink .	1
I could handle only two meats on the sandwich because it was too huge , so I shared my Brisket and ate some on the side , it was delicious and the pickle was good too .	1
We ordered : fury chicken wings- delicious ! , hell 's kitchen burger-average , the euro burger was pretty good .	1
Thank you for everything you did and will continue to do !	1
Jonathan Herring is a rockstar .	1
I this boutique and so does my fur baby , Bob !	1
The home made churro and ice cream sandwich is to DIE for .	1
last time we had lunch here the food was outstanding .	1
Love how they shake up the salads for you so everything is pre-mixed right before you eat .	1
Their TVs and other eletronic devices I think are quite reasonable .	1
The old man might scare you at times , but he does n't bite haha .	1
Best burger hands down .	1
All of this is really rounded out well with a slightly sweet `` yum yum sauce '' , mellow avacado , and just the right amount bitterness with the mixed greens .	1
End result : the house looks beautiful and Victors crews did an amazing job .	1
I would definitely return for more involved service .	1
This is the best poker room in Vegas .	1
Loved the crepes and other French favorites : niçoise , cassoulet , etc .	1
Awesome food and awesome service .	1
It was very heavenly .	1
They offer us locals a discount too !	1
My only complaint is that is located in southside and they should have another location , but that does n't change the fact that they make the best milk shakes and sundaes known to man kind !	1
We had a wonderful dinner here .	1
He 's my new best friend !	1
I always leave Diana feeling beautiful .	1
The service is very professional , a great experience every time .	1

Jillian is amazing at what she does .	1
But I continue to introduce others to Flock & Fowl because so much of their menu is simply as good as it gets !	1
Jay was so great and very detail oriented .	1
Everyone needs to try his Old Fashioned and my favorite The Hercules , its a peanut butter and jelly martini .	1
The decor is beautifully modern and cozy but the hard surfaces and number of clients can sure raise noise levels !	1
If there is a wait , you can order takeout on ice which still hits the spot and carries well if you 're only traveling a few minutes .	1
They have all the awesome shoes and can make special orders since they are a Nike top dealer .	1
The park next door is lovely and brings back major feelings of nostalgia and you can easily see all there is to see in the zoo in an hour .	1
Love this place !	1
This was my first time visiting and I was very impressed .	1
During dinner , you can also get frozen yogurt for dessert .	1
The customer is always right !	0
The staff is also fun and consists of quite a few college students .	1
The coffee is also good - and I am pretty picky about my coffee .	1
the bartender was super super sweet and very attentive without being overbearing and also very patient with the other customers who were getting obnoxious .	1
The flavorful red and green salsas are wonderful as well !	1
Their chili oil is also notable - strong flavour but not too spicy , perfect for those soup dumplings .	1
The escargot is a must and should be shared .	1
I think this is a place is a good place to celebrate and not really a quiet romantic dinner place .	1
Would visit again next time the weather is good and when I am in the area .	1
I will be back	1
It obviously has n't been that long ago and it has already taken my interest and satisfies my cravings !	1

All in all it was a good dining experience !	1

Tiny , tiny place with food to die for !	1
We finished with the ultra decadent layered chocolate hazelnut dessert with salty crunchy bits and a anchor steam .	1
I went into Pavement for a little retail therapy last week , and I was very impressed with the selection .	1
On the plus side , they have a great selection of various ethnic foods to go along with the typical fare .	1
: ) I love this place ! !	1
And it fits amazingly !	1
No frills food served quickly and authentically .	1
The food was yummy .	1
Walking up to the food court , you can instantly smell the wonderful spices used in Indian food .	1
On my most recent visit , I decided to change things up and tried their strawberry shortcake doughnut .	0
One of the best bakeries in the state as far as I 'm concerned .	1
The service team is prompt and have been able to fix all minor issues .	1
The burgers are great and the open salad bar makes this place all the more delicious .	1
The costumer service was amazing !	1
If you are looking to pay $ 8-12 for two-three meals worth come here !	1

Everything was delicious .	1
I previously thought seating was limited but was pleasantly surprised to see how much seating there was upstairs .	1
I ca n't recall exactly all that we had , but it was all fantastic .	1
Since then I can say that I 've tried pretty much everything they have on the menu !	1
These guys are quick , honest , and amazing .	1
This is my new favorite restaurant in LV ! ! !	1
Le cadre apporte une atmosphère cosy , si vous êtes dans le coin n'hésitez pas à y manger ( PS : le burger à l'agneau était fantastique ) .	1

I was able to sneak a couple bites of my friends ' dishes ( as you do ) and the food was consistently tasty .	1
The rest of my family , being their first time , enjoyed every bite of their meal . '	1
Amazing ! ! !	1
They give you big buttery portions of sashimi .	1
My second fav was the chicken samosas !	1
They make the best mango lassi .	1
My only suggestion I would suggest in this burrito is cut the meat smaller as I got really big chunks in mine and I feel it would be more beneficial cutting it into cubes .	1
Yummy !	1
The food is really good , I had the shrimp and grits ( something i have to try if its on any menu ) , i also tried the collards which were really good but spicy .	1
Regardless , it is a very delicious destination for lunch .	1
The food is amazing and the staff is delightful !	1
Luckily it was very easy to find in the store .	1
Creamy , velvety & smooth , one sip will have you feeling like you are sitting above the clouds on Wuyi mountain - where the tea is picked .	1
Vince and Giovanni did an amazing job today cleaning the windows of a home that I am listing .	1
I can not believe it has taken me this long to write a review about this quaint , fun shop .	1
I love their courtyard area and that they allow dogs on it-I just wished it was a place that I could get in/out of in an hour .	1
And the staff is beyond helpful and sweet .	1
They also have many yummy non-alcoholic beverage for those who are driving or just do not wish to get sloshed .	1
Panini 's are always a hit and if you 're in the mood for breakfast ... served all day !	1
They came on a sizzler and were perfectly cooked .	0

What this place teaches me about myself : I might just be equal parts sketchbag and hipster .	1
I have periodontal disease , so I knew I had to go , but to say I dreaded it is huge understatement .	1
I love St Louis with all my heart because of their suicide sauced wings .	1
I quite liked that the rice was n't fried together with the chicken and vegetables so that you could choose how savoury each bite could be .	1
Well done everyone !	1
And oh is it good !	1
I am a tea enthusiast and was very pleased with the knowledgeable and passionate staff !	1

I had my drink and got to watch my hubby relive some joyful moments from his childhood- which was honestly priceless .	1
We were only disappointed in the size of the scoops , which were about the size of a golf ball !	1
We sat for awhile , consuming tiny spoonfuls of our pistachio , coconut , and triple berry Gelato scoops and watched videos of how J-P artists engineer their chocolate creations .	1

But their food is absolutely thumbs up .	1

It is a little salty , but the sauce is so amazing that I will save it just to eat on rice alone : ) I also love their boiling fish , but not as strongly as the spicy beef .	1
The Corned Beef `` do n't call it '' Hash is melt in your mouth amazing .	1
Check this out and do n't forget the fountain show ! ! ! !	1
Carol is a very thorough and detailed esthetician , I never have to tell her to redo an area because she does a great job .	1

This place will always be a lunch favourite !	1
Each time I 've came in to receive a hairstyle we 've started on time , the service was professional and exceptional and I always leave feeling amazing ( even with the semi-tight braids pulling at my scalp lol ) .	1
It was homemade and fantastic .	1
Trust me it is outstanding !	1
It has a good selection of basic ingredients , including produce and meats , but just in case it does n't carry what you need , Hyvee and Copps are right across the street .	1
I get complements on my ring almost every day and I always reccomend James Elliot .	1
The inside of the establishment is always clean , even during busy lunch times .	1

Love the real taro taste .	1
I am obsessed with this place and here 's why .	1
I also live right across Independence Blvd so I order pizza from this location pretty often .	1
I will definitely be coming back for more .	1
Though their pizza is excellent , they also have great salads ( the small is big enough for 2 ) , and top notch vegetables .	1
I 've never made an appointment , have always done walk-ins and never had to wait more than 10 minutes ( I pick my polish color during my wait time ) .	1
My Family and I have been shopping here for many years and I can honestly say they have THE BEST PRICES IN TOWN !	1
I was BEYOND pleased with my brows when she finished them .	1
Our server was knowledgeable , professional and really personable .	1
The quality for the price is definitely one of the best deals in town .	1
My favorite was the Asian station , the pierogies and the desserts were delish !	1
I 'm not sure why there are mixed reviews here , maybe they 've changed management , but I can say that based on my experience last week , they deserve 5 stars .	1
The prices are reasonable and the turn-around is relatively quick .	1
I really do love this place and the food is really good .	1
I tried an imported Chinotto soda as an accompaniment ( think Brio , but better : ) ) , and finished off with a small plate of bombolones , an Italian fried donut sort of pastry , filled with vanilla cream or Nutella ( I had both ! ) .	1
Lance is a great entertainer the best magician I have seen in Vegas .	1
Excellent mix of indoor/outdoor environment .	1

A group of us ladies vacationing in Montreal a couple of weeks ago ended up having dinner at La Gargote restaurant based on our tour guide 's recommendation .	1

THEY MUST GET THE BEST SLEEP IN THE WORLD .	0

Fantastic food .	1
The smoothie was topped with coconut flakes which added a nice texture to your typical smoothie .	1
Obviously I was unable to finish it all , so we definitely had a bunch of food to take home ( which by the way was still delicious when I heated it up later ) I would definitely come back again !	1
This place is n't exactly `` expensive '' but it is a little on the pricier side for the portions you get .	1
They are pretty fast and friendly .	1
So good !	1

The music varied from hip hop , house , pop , and even remixed oldies .	1
Jennifer always does such a great job with my lashes !	1

I went here with my friend after a night of * ahem * good old Madison weekend fun , and this was exactly what we needed .	1

This place is simply AMAZING !	1
I have had everything from vintage half-moon manis , intricate tribal patterns , and ombre glitters from them .	1
And after walking inside the establishment , heaven .	1
A restaurant of this calibre is uniquely settled in Kensington ... it is relaxed and yet there is an obvious eye to all to the luxurious details .	1
I love that they have a drive thru , as usually an early morning donut run means we are still in our pjs !	1
Definitely recommend this dish if you love Japanese curry .	1
Amazing .	1

I 've been to the LA location and really enjoyed the food there .	1
prime filet , perfectly grilled , pepper cress and luscious reduction seared fois gras atop delectable sweet potato mash , and duck breast , sliced and with its own sweet sauce presentation was a bit off , seemingly rushed -- creme brulee with berries .	1
Absolutely love this place !	1

I 'm always impressed with their service .	1
Usually the pita is enough to feed me for two days which helps me a save a little on eating out for lunch every day : ) I forgot to snap some pics of the food but I 'll be back soon and will share more .	1
They offer a lot on their menu as well but we really wanted to just try the oysters and pan roast since that 's what we were craving .	1
Fetechini Alfredo- light sauce no x cheese on top & side of mozzarella cheese - Incredible !	1
They also bring a basket of bread ( they forgot ours ) as well as fried bananas , mashed potatoes and fried polenta .. be sure to skip that stuff and stick to the meats and salad bar .	1

I had the bibimbap and it was delicious .	1
She does an absolute fantastic job on the trouble spots and does an overall excellent job .	1

This is by far my favorite buffet in Vegas , and I ca n't wait to go back .	1
The chicken is tender and just the right moisture level .	1
For Dessert I love their freshly homemade Flan , I usually ordered extra to take home for my family .	1
That 's the only slightly negative thing I can say about the place , and it was really not a big deal .	1
I love the soft but not overpowering scent , really just smells clean and fresh which is nice after long NYC days .	1
They were bursting with unique flavors and not hiding behind the mask of being overly sweet .	1

they were bigger than the XLB but also had a good amount of soupy goodness in them .	1
Finally , I 've found an Italian restaurant that serves great food and meets it 's own expectations : keeping it simple .	1

It is BOMB !	1
The service was some of the best I 've ever seen .	1
Everything was great and I would definitely recommend this place !	1
My new favorite spot !	1

Si vous travaillez dans le coin , je vous recommande chaudement cet endroit pour le lunch !	1
Oh my goodness .... time decided to stop during my lunch break because every bite was so orgasmic and I began to cherish every bite I took .	1
The only thing they ca n't do is take any type of reward that has a code , but free rewards can absolutely be redeemed here .	1
If you can remember to hate the game , not the player , then they are amazing !	1
He always does a great job and takes pride in his work .	1
Definitely will be back .	1

The location is in the middle of Old Brooklyn and surprisingly , I never have had to wait , although it 's almost always bustling with other tables but you 're still easily able to hold a conversation .	1
I will always hit this place up for presents when it comes to my niece and nephew because they have a large selection and they 're located close to home .	0
The mango chicken lunch special was awesome - but my sa cha chicken dinner on a return visit was even better , and the bite of the triple charm special definitely put up there on my `` to order next '' list .	1
Atmosphere - Modern and clean with Chinese murals and a mirrored wall to one side giving the place a nice sense of spaciousness .	1
For dessert , we got the peach cobbler , which was ridiculously enormous for 2 people since it also comes with a huge scoop of ice cream in a cookie shell bowl and a baked cinnamon twist thing .	1
The burger was full of flavor and nice n juicy .	1
Meat was cooked thoroughly , and goes great with rice !	1
The fish was extremely tender and flavourful .	1
You wo n't be disappointed ... and definitely not a waste of your money .	1

The staff are extremely reliable , kind , and truly concerned whenever an issue arises .	1
there was a jazzy band playing softly which just adds to the light , airy feel .	1
Easily the best experience we 've ever had with a moving company .	1
First time I stayed was perfect , even though I did have an unwanted charge to me room , but I did not question the charge as I was too drunk to remember the prior night .	1
The service is also exceptionally good .	1
Beautiful wood tables with mismatched chairs offers a comfortable setting to enjoy all of the comforts this chef has to offer .	1
I 've never had Filipino food before but this was worth the try .	1
La Taguara is some of the best food I 've had .	1

I love this location !	1

She helped me find some great deals .	1
Good drinks highly recommend getting the cheese mousse topping with whatever drink you 're getting ( black coffee and matcha are good choices ) .	1
We had a great time a few nights while we were in town for a conference .	1
This will definitely be a place we will have to visit whenever passing through this area .	1
They have a great outdoor covered space which would be great to enjoy margaritas .	1
Her partner is fun and has some serious color skills too .	1
He was even accommodating when my neighbor complained about the noise .	1
By far this is the best coffee spot in downtown Toronto .	1
The cashier is great and always happy .	0
She was by far the best massage therapist I 've been to .	1
Kinda my style of cooking but above all , excellent service , but yes , servers need to work on punctual timing in serving everything according to service .	1
Definitely a good choice if you have a crowd with lots of different food requests .	1
The volcano roll looked fantastic .	1
The bread they use are really good stuff .	1

They also have a patio and complimentary WiFi .	1
A large dirt parking lot right next to the bar makes it very easy to stop by at for a quick drink .	1

- Jared La Rue	0
We scored the circular high-backed banquette booth in the back - which made us all feel real classy and shit -- as if the tuscan-paint scheme , candles and chandeliers were n't enough .	1

The service is great and the employees are so nice it makes the experience that much better !	1
Reminds me of the theatres from the 90 's , which is n't bad by any measure but not as comfortable as the newer Cineplex theatres .	1
Staff has been friendly , and efficient .	1
Definitely a place worth going back to !	1

This was our 2nd visit and again we had a phenomenal meal .	1
The food was very tasty , and the portions were surprisingly big .	1
Sushi and desserts were a bit of a letdown but had amazing dishes like goat cheese and mushrooms salad , meats , indian , and chinese food .	1
His prices are very reasonable .	1
An order of cheese dip came quickly to the table and it was delicious .	1
While it was a great meal , I do n't think that the portions we were served and the level of service ( by design of the counter seating , not at all to the fault of the servers , they were fantastic ! )	1
Definitely one of the best pedicures I 've got in a while !	1
Had my consultation 3 weeks ago , booked an appointment and tadaaa lol Janette thank you for doing what you love and giving my tattoo life !	1

My hubby and I went here on Valentine 's Day a few years ago , and we were so impressed with the menu and the service .	1
We bought several to try , the bacon maple was for breakfast , had the salty carmel for lunch and finished with the seasonal cherry chocolate for dinner ... win win !	1
It took me awhile to get my perfect sauce combination down , but once I did I was in heaven .	1
So many great flavors and toppings to choose from .	1

Delicious ! ! !	1
I highly recommend Yvettes	1
We decided we were the most skeptical about a Rootbeer flavoured doughnut , so we decided to try that first .	1

I love The Juice Standard and did n't think I would BEE addicted !	1
For our entrees , we both had seafood entrees -- mine was a pasta with prawns ( head-on shrimp ) and a cream sauce over some vegetables , and his was a swordfish plate ( I believe ) , both also from the chalkboard .	1
They have 50 under 50 as part of the list with alot of great surprises !	1

As in the past she was on the mark about things heavy on my mind and she even gave me suggestions as to how I needed to progress .	1

I was with a loved one who has been to France ( lived there for a year ) and the overwhelming consensus was -- tres bon .	1
The Chateau at the top- nice architecture but just a space to rest - mostly everyone is outdoors enjoying the view - taking pics and listening to music .	1
She even went above and beyond by making my escort cards and table numbers for me as I 'm not much of a DIY person AT All !	1

When it is warmer , the patio and bands are awesome and we do trivia night here every now and then .	1
I had the smores dessert and it was okay-I would prefer a stronger marshmallow flavor .	1
Unlike some other Vietnamese restaurants who make similar entrees , Pho Van keeps the vinegar based sauce on the side , which you 'll be thankful for moderation when you get near the bottom of the bowl .	1

They have more than one location in Vegas but they all fill up fast so be prepared to wait .	1
On the contrary , my dreams are haunted every night by their bacon wrapped scallops and I often crave the pulled pork nachos ( which are HUGE , delicious , and great value for money ) Mini update : The corn bread here is mega dry , borderline inedible .	1
awesome service !	1
The menu is huge and extensive , and I 've never had a bad dish off of it .	1
I 've been getting macarons , cupcakes , cookie sandwiches , and even my birthday cake from here for the past year now and I 've never been let down when I try something new .	1

Their menu is simple with includes pictures of the different varieties of ramen and offers three choices for broth ( have the Miso version , that is my favorite ) .	1

Friendly people , delicious pizza .	1
My go-to scoops are london fog , black tea , and banana bread pudding - but if those flavours are n't up your alley , there are a ton more to choose from , all unique and super delicious .	1
But the fact that there is a place in the Valley to scratch this culinary itch is easily worth 4 stars in my book .	1
The atmosphere was really nice too .	1
I had the pleasure of trying Café Parvis 's soup of the day at lunchtime today : the crème de cauliflower .	1
I was amazed with how comfy and spacious the place was for 4 people !	1

The food selections included such things as a sublime lobster salad as well as a rather rich , but oh-so-divine Kobe short rib ( topped with whole eggs and Bernaise sauce ) .	1
It 's like a secret menu .	1
Give it a try !	1
Definitely a great value for the quality/size of food !	1
La clientèle est diverse .	1
Right where they say they are going to be ... And the prices are very competitive w other companies ..	1

All the food was delicious and of great , fresh , quality .	1
Cute bistro located in strip mall .	1
It 's minimalistic as you can get !	1

But then again , simplistic ingredients with mind provoking art , a warm atmosphere and a chef and his wife with passion .. all day long !	1
The outside looks small and the sign is rather simple but dont judge it by its extorior appearance it is much nicer inside and I would definitely come back for lunc or dinner to try more items on the menu and get that thai iced tea again !	1
I recently moved to Scottsdale from the East Coast .	0
Nelly is the owner of Charnel and she is a genius !	1

It looked exactly how I wanted and tasted great !	1
Thank you Gen !	1
Dip the fries in their ranch dressing , it is amazing !	1
This was the winner of the night when you omit fried cheese from the experience ( because let 's face it , fried cheese always wins ) .	1
The sauce has a great amount of heat , which is cut down by the homemade guacamole and sour cream .	1
Malgré tout , c'est un très bonne place pour prendre une bière et les speciaux sur les drinks et shooters sont pas chère .	1
Loved the kebab and the chicken biriyani .	1
The bread they use is incredible .	1
We recommend all our friends to them and everyone has always been so happy with their service and frames .	1
But on that visit , Verde impressed me .	1
She even remembered my face and app order from my first visit .	1
I tried my brother 's oatmeal and it was among the best I 've had .	1
Well balanced .	1
My red color is something no other colorist has been able to get `` right '' and the compliments I get on Trina 's work really confirm that she is worth it !	1
Both were so delicious ! ! ! !	1
Awesome staff as well !	1
Wonderful food and very interesting concept to food blending .	1
I ordered the beet salad , braised Kurobuta pork with potato custard , seared California Halibut with Putanesca puree and Cinnamon roasted duck breast .	1
The food is served up quick , the atmosphere is wonderful , service on point , and the food delicious .	1
These were very good and not your usual fare .	1
Cool sculpting is also a wonderful thing .	1
The corn side is grilled on the cob then sliced off -- delicious as well .	1
Today I went in to get my hair done from Christopher for the first time and he did an amazing job ! !	1
La Santísima is fantastic .	1

The steak ... the best steak frites I 've ever had in Montreal after a lifetime of immersion : perfectly cooked ribeye , simple reduction , pile of fries to the ceiling .	1

The rooms are very clean and up to date .	1
I shared a lovely cheese fondue with my boss , had several nice glasses of red and finished with a seafood trio including snow crab legs , gravadlax ( salmon ) and tuna tartar .	1
I have to say the one near my house , Power Rd and Baseline Rd is one of the best .	1
Definitely coming back for microneedling !	1
Price is reasonable which gives you homestyle food .	1
Les soupes ont le bon bouillon , le thé aux bulles est suffisamment bon aussi loin à l'Est du quartier chinois de Montréal , la salle à manger , bien que fréquentée par des visages moins asiatiques qu'originaires du Plateau Mont-Royal , est plutôt occupée aux heures d'achalandage .	1
Oh I also got a lemon raspberry muffin which was a recommendation and it was fantastic .	1
But you know what makes the experience top notch is our favorite server Mark !	1
We were able to sit outdoors on a really nice night .	1

Very cool & hip wine bar with wonderful wines & great service .	1
The place has good eats , lounges that serve potent drinks , an awesome bowling alley , and a really clean movie theater .	1
I would still say Harumi is my favorite of the numerous Downtown sushi spots as I 'm a fan of the no frills places that dish out high quality stuff .	1
They moved across the street and expanded quite a bit .	1
Best pedi I 've had for a while .	1
As a large-format photographer and general control-freak , I really was very impressed by both the service here and the final output .	1

My tile floor is amazingly clean and the grout is fabulous .	1
Great , friendly service will def be going back soon !	1
This is our new favorite place !	1
Jason knew not only the food inside and out , but the entire wine list , which is very thoughtfully put together .	1
Luckily I was n't too hungry but I 'm thinking the portions are not huge since there 's a lot of ingredients in the salad , either way enjoyed the meal would definitely come back .	1
The food is always excellent and the service timely and friendly .	1
Bravo !	1
Everything was fresh and Donna the owner was so nice .	1
I do n't know the first thing about this stuff luckily Colin Ford and his sales girl were there to help , he wrapped up everything nicely and gave me a little Kate Spade postcard to write a nice note to go along with my gift .	1

I was home visiting family in Pittsburgh and was thrilled to see an Indian restaurant easily accessible to the Aspinwall/Blawnox communities .	1
Started off with oysters which were fresh and tasty and we both finished with the lamb which was interesting as there were two different cuts and cooks ( seared and braised ) .... tender and not too gamey .	1
The Firenzastone Staff were extremely professional they listened to what I was looking for and not only provided what I wanted but also gave me suggestions that I had n't considered !	1

Great place to get good food that 's kid friendly .	1
The setting is casual enough where you can come in from a day walking the strip and sit down for a great meal .	1
If they can make this an indoor mall , I 'd give 100 stars : D	1
Fun , challenging , no long lines !	1
Long line , but lots of choices , seafood were fresh , food were tasty , tons of desserts to choses , Icecream was smooth n cream .	1

The atmosphere can fit your needs whether it 's a girls/boys night out , date night , lunch or dinner or postgame grub spot .	1
There are different ranges of hills , emerald , blue and black and several of each so the wait is not bad at all .	1
Using Adam Carmer 's CSTEM methodology you will imbue your tastebuds and olfactory senses to a more modern and simple way to ensure you have the best whisky experience possible .	1

Also great complimentary bar and food and away from the main terminal .	1
Only complaint is that the deli and bar are at opposite sides of the store .	1
The team at Elegant Nail has always done a great job taking care of me .	1

Ca n't wait to come back and see him !	1
Other than that , another standout dish was the Pork Stew dish ( listed under the northern thai section ) , the Larb ( norther thai style ) , and this duck curry dish .	1
I would highly recommend this pizza and will no doubt order pizza again the next time I 'm in Vegas !	1
So glad I found Javier !	1
The only drawback was the brisket seemed a little tougher than other brisket .	1
Only thing I would say is the lighting is a bit bright , especially in the evening .	1
I am definitely staying here again for my birthday weekend !	1
They go above and beyond to work around my schedule and in the seldom event that something is n't right , ( nobody 's perfect after all ) a quick call or text to Jessica ( the owner ) , gets the problem rectified quickly .	1
I highly recommend .	1
Mat has helped me every year for the past four or five years .	1

It 's great for a little gift or a cute postcard .	1
Absolutely brilliant , wish I would have thought of it myself .	1
food was delicious , no complaints : D - Bread is amazing !	1

Wow , the spicy beef bulgogi really hit the spot .	1
I look forward to coming back to explore the rest of the menu ...	1
where he was rated # 2 and complimented him on his operation .	1
She was super nice and extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu .	1
Donna took me promptly at 7 pm and I have n't been this happy with my hair for years now !	1
My margarita was also very tasty , my boyfriend asked for spicy margarita , which they do n't have on the menu but they made anyways for him so that was a plus !	1
I can only give four stars at this time as we only shared a few appetizers , but when we return for a full meal and if it is consistent with the appetizers we had I 'd gladly give it five stars .	1
However , Rustique has managed to create the perfect mini pie .	1
We 'll definitely be back to try some of the usual menu items or at least to grab some take-out for a night at home .	1
Went with a party of five and the food and service was top notch .	1
She made sure everything was taken care of in a timely manner .	1

There is less breading and more cheese than other places and they are SO good .	1
Lorna is the mixmaster behind the bar , Evan always takes care of us Alyssa runs the BEST bloody bar and then Bonnie is always the best Hostess	1
Our table had a pleasant view of their outdoor waterfall which was especially nice because it was pouring rain and made for a very nice view .	1
CONCLUSION I highly , highly recommend this show though I have only seen two other Cirque Du Soleil shows , Ka was the most entertaining and totally worth the money !	1
Well long story short , the cream cheese shrimp tempura is awesome ( although something in there besides cream cheese and shrimp might have made it a little better ) and the garlic chicken was pretty darn good .	1
Everyone loved it .	1
A driver from Enterprise name Kobi came and picked me up and was very friendly and helpful .	1
Just recently moved from Lawrenceville , but this was a regular spot for me when I lived there .	1
The wrap was great , potato salad - fantastic , and side of kale - mmm mmm .	1
It had a great energy and service ran smoothly considering the rush .	1
Each large area was divided into smaller sections displaying musical instruments , artwork and artifacts from countries all across the globe .	1
Loved to see the mix of ages either there for the park or for the game .	1
I 'm not sure why this place got so many negative reviews - might I add reviews that skewed me away from this place for awhile , but I 'm definitely glad I bit the bullet and tried it out .	1
So good !	1

I like that they have the non emergency advice line which has come in handy quite a bit being a first time mom .	1

She also offers man-zillians , which is cool because not a lot of places wax men in that way .	1
I 'm giving it 4 stats because the chips and salsa were so - so and my chicken was dry but the carne asada steak was amazing !	1

The best seafood and water show on the strip .	1
At the Yelp event , I love love love loved the lamb meatball ( which seems to actually be the lamb burger on the menu ) and the smart chicken .	1
It was very nice to be able to stay about a mile away from the strip and for such a reasonable price .	1
I arrived right as they opened , The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable , and they had me in and out in 19 minutes .	1
My favorite dishes are Deep Fried Crispy Chicken , and Salt and Pepper Squid , usually accompanied by one of the house Fried Rices .	1

definitely my favorite costco in town especially because of the 4 self-checkout terminals !	1
Brandon was friendly and provided a great quote .	1
Leah and jessi are good artists but the owner cliff `` duke '' will try to sell you junk jewelry and call it top of the line .	0
I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good quality reasonably priced vehicle , they treated us like family and I 'm sure they treat everyone with the same respect .	1
The maintenance was always quick and considerate , the front office staff is very nice and helpful , and the community itself is fairly calm and quiet .	1

Pricier than I would have thought but it was still a nice dinner in a nice neighborhood .	1
Great coffee from Pilot Roasters !	1
Only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the hot entree prices seemed a little bit steep , but all together my food and drink came to a total of $ 12.75 and completely filled me up .	1
That is on me ... and I had only wished that I had tried this place sooner .	1
They even have fresh baked treats which look good enough for me to eat lol	1

It looks like they also have crepes and coffee and yummy stuff that every girl dreams of .	1
Both are truly unique and totally relaxing .	1
My rose sparkling wine was perfect and a great prelude to our amazing dinner at the Larder and the Delta .	1
I also enjoyed their Bank Roll , PCH , Ninja , Rainbow Roll , and Tropicana Roll .	1
The design services I 've purchased are first-rate !	1
The prices are fair given the area , clocking in about middle-of-the-pack for Thai places in the Valley .	1
It 's nice to be tucked away from all the posers .	1
I actually think I will like doing laundry now !	1
Great place to grab a bag full of bagels to go or enjoy your breakfast seated ( or standing at the window shelves ) .	1

Absolutely , hands-down the best dish out there .	1
All of their employees are always very friendly and nice .	1
A bonus is that they have wine , which is perfect when you are heading over after a long day at work : )	1
I decided I would get my pup slowly accustomed to HeartStrings by dropping him off for a couple of hours a day , once or twice a week , until we both felt comfortable .	1
All of the guys were friendly and professional .	1
Delicious , excellent service , cozy place to dine and take friends or family .	1
Staff are very friendly and atmosphere is very laid back .	1
Maybe drinking healthy smoothies and juice IS really good for you .	1
They are perfect !	1

The place has good food and friendly service .	1

The first time the boyfriend and I came here , I was a little skeptical it would n't be that good compared to traditional Korean BBQ places .	1

Awesome place with good beer !	1
The breakfast here is great and classic .	1

My only other minor gripe about this place is the very old-school Japanese music that is playing on repeat in the background .	1
This is definitely a place to try .	1
Staff is friendly and service is very prompt .	1
Great prices and great quality .	1
It is a big place so usually easy to get a table or seat at the bar .	1
Will definitly be back and a bonus is having the used vinyl section .	1
There was a little bit of everything .... toe readings , massages , facials , waxing , herbalist , life coaches , chiropractors , artists , natural cosmetics , energy readings , teeth whitening .... and the list goes on .	1
I would also say they served the best Tandoori chicken I have ever tasted , hands down .	1
I 'm so grateful for botox and for Victoria and all her experience .	1
Split it all with my date and it made for the perfect late night bite .	1
Needless to say I 'm hooked .	1

Fantastic time !	1
The jeans look perfect and the replacement buttons match great !	1
Scallops were absolutely perfect , and I 'm in agreement with everyone else that these guys would get enough traffic to stay open if they only served their Brussels sprouts .	1
The garlic bread was delicious with fresh tomatoes and a chimchurri sauce that tasted fresh and amazing .	1
Great service , great food , and an amazing ambiance , what more can you ask for in a steakhouse ..	1
I was a little apprehensive about what it would be like based on yelp reviews , but was excited to experience it nonetheless .	1
Recently open in the Streetsville area of Mississauga , Goodfellas is a very welcome addition for Italian food lovers .	1

Highly recommended .	1
Also looks like an awesome place for ice cream ( maybe when it gets warmer out again !	1
This pizza was sooooo good ! ! !	1
And the waitress was extremely knowledgeable already .	1
The jalapenos added a nice kick to the burger .	0

Their blood orange cucumber mint mojitos are just simply what I imagine heaven must taste like .	1
Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard served with toasted baguette 4 stars out of 5 To be honest , French is n't my go-to but I was with some friends who love this place .	1
They had a Carolina BBQ sauce and their house sauce -- both were delicious .	1
Sort of a chefs table with the viewing of the chefs in the background working hard this is quite possibly the best restaurant I 've been to yet .	1
In fact , they have specials every day .	1
The theater offers a variety of menu items beyond the typical popcorn and candy .	1
Fantastic dentist .	1
Market Grille is my absolute favorite restaurant .	1

I order the italian beef and onion and have n't been disappointed - generous ingredients with melted mozz oozing out .	1
Lobster Bisque is amazing .	1
The only problem is that they are always busy .. because so many people already know how good a shop this is .	1
It was cooked perfectly and finished it before the Leafs could score the second goal against the Habs .	1
Plus , the dealers were fun which is always a bonus .	1
We will definitely go back .	1
There is usually a beverage cart out ( at least on the weekends ) , and a pretty decent restaurant for your turn snack and post-round meal .	1
I would return just for the caesar salad - it was that good !	1
I love this place .	1
You are amazing .	1

It was definitely diabetes in a cup but so worth it as a treat for every once in a while .	1
They make it an enjoyable trip every time i come in .	1

Not only were the Pecan Red Rock Candy Apple & the English Toffee Candy Apple AMAZING but hearing the process of how they make their treats as well as their family history which was extremely enjoyable ! !	1
First off , it 's new and the outside façade with the waterfall makes it so cool in the Vegas heat .	1
The people are very nice , but I still have a cut that is difficult to style and is n't the most complimentary to my face or the quality of my hair .	0
Also , one thing I like is seeing everything clean and everyone diligently working .	1
All the dishes we have had at Barrio Queen have been perfectly cooked , plated and taste amazing .	1
The fireplace is original to the house ( 1991 ) and is a special type of thick glass , not something readily available by a typical glass repair shop I discovered .	1

I still fly every other month to see Kelly because she is THE best ! !	1
I 'm a huge steak person and this was a great cut of beef and it was flavored well .	1
It 's a little pricey , but the drinks and food are really good .	1
It 's not as swanky as iPic , which feels like a nightclub in Vegas , but it 's much cheaper ( $ 12 per ticket for smaller theatres , $ 15 for stadium ) , and you get the wait staff here as well .	1
The food is different than typical bar food , in a great way ! ! !	1
As I 'm vegetarian and most often make healthier decisions I 'm not too into the happy hour food selection but I 'm sure many would be .	1

What a find !	1
fun alive competitive and sympathetic	1
We also got half the pork baby rack ribs which was delicious and solid .	1
7.5 out of 10 Very nice classy modern restaurant , but not too the point where it 's too fancy .	1
They start off with the basics but they also have fun at the same time .	1
Chris , the bartender , offered to remove the burger from our order , without us asking or expecting him to do so , which was awesome !	1
The garlic pork spare ribs and red snapper is my favorite .	1

Will definitely be back .	1
Unfortunately I have n't had the opportunity to take a class with the owner , Rebecca Lammersen , but I follow her on Twitter and read her articles on Elephant Journal and am always impressed with her mindset .	1
I always love their cute little packaging .	1
I has the best pastrami sandwich ever here -- both the Szmidt and the Kreege sandwiches are to die for .	1
Both were divine -- I 'm drooling a little just thinking about it .	1
So , the staff is super patient and courteous .	1
Our group had an awesome time hanging out inside , enjoying a few beers , and dancing our way through the crowd !	1

If you have neck or back pain , I strongly recommend Vitality Chiropractic .	1
Khao soi is only for those of you who know for a fact that you like khao soi as a dish .	1
It is a little pricey but worth the money and the portions are reasonable .	1

But overall this place has delivered a consistently delicious made-to-order burger and perfectly cooked fries ( crunchy outside , tender inside ) and does it quickly .	1
Talking about wonderful bread ... and their sandwiches are really good too .	1
I will return to Urban Picnic and recommend trying it out next time you 're in downtown Mesa .	1
Margaret is the best !	1
A five star experience at a five star price !	1
Although there 's a bit of a wait , it 's worth it since the food is great , and it let 's you enjoy the atmosphere .	1
Coffee was superb and the service was spot on !	1
They just read the listings off to us ) Seared foie gras - Good but the foie gras was sliced pretty thin so getting that really good flavor in the middle was kind of missing .	1
Had a great experience everyone was very helpful .	1
Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable .	1
I also love that they have pup cups , my dog is a big fan of the vanilla ice cream with the little biscuit on top !	1
Stopped in after watching a movie at the Carlton theatre , fast service with reasonably priced beer .	1

The service is excellent .	1
We ca n't say enough great things about a Notable Sound .	1
Well , while not entirely true , I did make Border Grill the first stop on our gluttonous trip through Vegas , and my friends agreed that it was delicious .	1
The `` chicken '' was fried to a golden perfection , perfectly seasoned , and amazingly moist .	1
The office opens 9-hours a day , and her cell phone is available 24/7 to her clients .	1
This store is amazing !	1
My freshly squeezed grapefruit juice was delicious and refreshing .	1
If you love good classic donuts and you 're in the area this is a great place .	1
The only negative is that the onions on the burger were really strong and I had to remove a few of them .	1
A well deserved recommendation for this award winning crew .	1
Love coming here for the gelati !	1
A lot of rolls to choose from , a nice atmosphere , and the staff was super friendly .	1

You will never regret it	1
He and his staff are patient and kind every time .	1
They were great helping me figure out how much I needed and coordinated timing with me .	1

Crispy avocado and asparagus with sweet chili sauce- another favorite 6 .	1
We decided that the Bach 37 Strad with the Sterling Plus Silver Bell was the way to go !	1
The service was excellent .	1
Overall , a great place .	1
Very honest , helped me identify the problem with my fan .	1
It 's a `` tapas '' style concept , except the portions are a little bit bigger .	1
The decor was clean and modern with plenty of TV 's and the place was well maintained .	1
Probably one of the more fancier restaurants we have visited , a very relaxed and cozy ambience although a little too dark in the rooms in our opinion .	1
It 's great , and there 's a good amount of variety .	1
Great service , very friendly to us non-French speaking tourists !	1
The service was on point both times I went and the food as well as plate presentation were outstanding .	1
But this place is the best .	1
the location , a block from Fremont Street , made this spot convenient for partying , and also serenity since it was n't right on top of Fremont .	1
The last comic is why this review gets five stars .	1
Being with Somerset I did n't realize that the uniform vendor had changed and I am sooo happy they did .	1

AN OATMEAL COOKIE !	1
It was great to be able to talk to someone who had such passion and cared about his craft .	1
DK pasta is great and fresh .	1
The service was a little slow , but because the food was so amazing we can forget that .	1
It is clean , efficient and fast !	1
The atmosphere was really really really nice , unpretentious , I like that it 's just an authentic Mexican restaurant , it 's refreshing in Toronto since most of the taco places are trendy hipster places geared towards foodie culture .	1
Last I would love to compliment the bathrooms and the amazing tub .	1
I would definitely go again .	1
Her chocolates are both super pretty and the flavor is out of this world .	1
No one ever fail in making chocolate martini so far : ) Service : awesome !	1
The staff recommended the `` Annihilator '' - which is a flavor addition of some breve cream with macadamia nut .	1
Oh and ask for Darlene she is super helpful	1
The portions here are enormous !	1
Honestly , this place has THE BEST cookies and pastries .	1
Not as light and fluffy as I prefer but this could do with the fact that we visited at almost noon so the difference a few hours makes in texture and consistency is something to note .	1
I think Sunday brunch is bottomless mimosas too but as anyone who visits Vegas , I 'd already had my fair share of booze for the weekend .	1
USGas is the BEST CARWASH SERVICE and Manager George and associate Yamil are very Customer Centric and courteous ! !	1
The puff pastry is an awesome upgrade to this meal , and the mustards on the side are incredible .	1
I had my first appointment at BarbiiGirlNails and what an awesome surprise .	1

Love this new location .	1
Sun Cyclery rocks !	1
This is a private pilates studio in the downtown area in the CBD .	0
I was impressed with the 'court marshal ' ; she was on the ball and making sure that kids did n't co-occupy jump squares , and that they did n't lie or sit down to rest while in the jumping area .	1
The ribs were as good as always , nice and meaty .	1
I 'd consider Mayworth Public House to be a higher-quality , more reasonably priced alternative to some place like The Liberty in Charlotte .	1
The casual , chic and bright decor - love everything about this place .	1
Recently had to get my retainer replaced and they got me right in , were so friendly and made everything as easy as possible !	1
Thank you so much !	1
I 've known Erik for a few years now and would recommend him to anyone looking to buy a house !	1

With that being said , you got ta try it ! !	1
I was also surprised how good the food is .	1
That 's a nice perk I have n't seen in Toronto .	1
The staff is great , ticketing was easy , drinks are HUGE ( and really you just need 1 , they 're about $ 24 each , but they really are gigantic ) , lights , sound , choreography are all top notch .	1
That 's dedication !	1
Service is attentive .	1
I will be coming back !	1
Bruschetta and calamari were also great !	1
is a gem .	1
Additionally , Debbie & Shane in the front desk area are amazing !	1
If you are looking for a place to feel God 's love and a home , this is the church for you !	1
The salon itself is very laid back and not the slightest bit pretentious .	1
nice chill feel .	1
They also serve other cocktails , but if it 's Tex Tubb 's , I 'm having a margarita , and I 'll have it from a pitcher or in my own special glass , please and thank you .	1
A lot of good cuts of meat , I will definitely be coming to this place more .	1
Lastly , the spray tan was fast and easy .	1
Food is always good and service is fast .	1

We were greeted immediately which was awesome .	1
Today my boy Richard Z had the Monsoon , which they 're soon to be famous for ( it looked amazing ) and I had the vegan version of their veggie sub , which was outstanding .	1
We will be coming back .	1
Parking is a little tricky at times but I think Upward Projects has done a great job adding more parking for all their restaurants at this intersection .	1
The burgers and fries ( and yes , shakes ) are really good .	1
Nice vibe and super friendly service .	1
The techs showed up right on time , completed the work , cleaned up and hauled off my old water heater !	1
Not sure if it was the owner or a manager handing them out but he was incredibly friendly and gave us recommendations on what to order next time based on our tastes .	1
The staff here is very helpful too .	1
I would highly recommend 12 Volt Solutions to everybody before taking your car elsewhere .	1

But they are really good at what they do !	1
I added jalapeño to mine , as I love the heat .	1
Amazing customer service !	1
The tapas ( small , sharable plates ) are tasty .	1
Melinda was fantastic .	1
Thanks Kyle , we 'll be using you again .	1
Ale was amazing .	1
I 'm biased living in San Diego and having killer options every day .	1
And my favourite sandwich , the steelhead trout , was one week so big I needed three hands to lift it , the next week it was a teeny little tea sandwich , I could have eaten three .	1
I have had their cronut too , but it was a little too sweet for my liking .	1
Great lasagne that really hits the spot !	1
They saved my hide , and probably my job too !	1
Best tacos ever !	1
My boyfriend brought it home for dinner one night and wow !	1

There is a nice balcony area where you could have a quieter conversation .	1
I 'm usually disappointed but these were delicious .	1
Desserts were a definite treat .	1
Steaks are fabulous too .	1
You might find yourself staying up until 5am just wandering around and admiring this place and then grabbing a bite to eat at Zooza Crackers only to find that you 're still as energetic as ever .	1
The variety of colors offered was pretty impressive too -- we were able to match our trim color and body of the house color nearly perfectly .	1
I was amazed by their talent compare to their young age .	1
Boom , found my barber !	1
Wine bar is worthy of the best wine snobs .	1
The Stetson salad alone is worth it .	1
Best grooming team I 've ever been to and I highly recommend her .	1
I was in here to pick up a couple of gifts ( I do n't shop here for myself - too expensive ) , and one of the girls was great for helping me find what I needed .	1
The facility is very clean and the equipment seems to be in top shape .	1
I wanted to visit a warm place and ride my bike in my birthday and they helped me check that bucket list .	1

Yes , it 's as awesome as it sounds .	1
A fun ice cream sandwich shop !	1
See ya soon !	1
My usual staple !	1
She is professional kind and delightful to work with .	1
¡JUST AMAZING !	1
I would n't dream of going anywhere else !	1
got ta player 's card & will hopefully get some great offers .	1
Shrimp scampi appetizer was also fantastic .	1
This place is phenomenal .	1
For appetizers - we ordered the bacon wrapped dates ( which was the first time we 've tried anything so creative ) .	1
The layout is the best I 've seen for efficiency and presentation .	1
I enjoy their prohibition inspired drinks the most and try a new one every time I go .	1
Many of the vegetables are grown on site so if you want freshness this is the place to be !	1
Perfect Friday night !	1
When the owner ( Hammer ) is there he always makes sure to say hi and make sure you enjoy your food .	1
Great atmosphere , very low key and relaxing .	1
Everyone there is very friendly and welcoming .	1
Even the OJ is squeezed there fresh daily .	1
It is pretty neat and they blast ac in there so it does n't stink ( as much ) .	1
Light but with just the right amount of density where you can eat 2 and be completely satisfied .	1
The food was pretty good !	1
Our server Julie was also amazing .	1
I recently tried the rice with grilled pork , and let me tell you that meat was so succulent it makes my mouth water everytime I think about it .	1
This place is fantastic !	1
Full disclosure : I have yet to try the pharmacy at this location , which is the only reason I did not give them five stars .	1
Yeah , so this place , pretty good !	1
While it 's true that there are several exhibits that are more child-focused , many of the exhibits are sophisticated enough for adult enlightenment and enjoyment .	1
This place is as good as it gets for a taste of the Chesapeake Bay !	1
Would go back again if I was in the area .	1
A must-try cafe !	1
I chose Marty over others we got quotes from because he has a superior product , but after installation I am most impressed with Marty 's care & concern .	1
The roof top dog park also makes it super convenient for me to take my dog to do his business without having to leave the property .	1
# 2- all food was extremely good ! !	1
Yes it 's a little pricey but it 's def worth it , the staff is always super friendly and they seem to have specials every day .	1
Best brunch in Vegas !	1
This DD is my everyday go-to .	1
The place has a great atmosphere ; the dim lighting really works .	1
The cheese was very fresh and made in NC and the prices were reasonable .	1
Mussels were a great appetizer .	1
The wait staff was really great and made awesome recommendations ( the hostesses were n't the warmest but I 'll chalk that up to a slammed waiting area and Brody Jenner and some guy from the Jersey Shore being there !	1
They have a great selection of thrifty ice creams .	1
I strongly recommend this place !	1
The Reuben pierogies were so delicious .	1
Only the second time I 've ever had my eyebrows done , and Lizzy was amazing !	1
I will keep coming back here as long as they service and food are great !	1
Decor is very hip and trendy .	1
Large room with charming decor in Old Montreal .	1
Also if you ever want a quiet spot to work , this is great since the WiFi is so strong !	1
She is very nice , down to earth , and easy to talk to .	1
Had an awesome time here .	1
With that out of the way , I 've done both rooms and can tell you that this is the best escape experience I have ever had - they clearly put a lot of thought into this and money into infrastructure .	1
Candy themed drinks ! ! ! !	1
I highly recommend this place !	1
The Wigwam is a true gem on the west side ; adjacent to Blu Sushi and Taps - two other highly recommended establishments .	1
Staff was super friendly and the atmosphere is fun and casual .	1
The STK establishment of course is really pricey but if you want to treat yourself you wo n't regret it .	1
The free services , tire inflation , complimentary patches , are such a testament to their overall m.o .	1
My favorites : Pad See Ew , Prig Khing stirfry , Lava Trio , and Bangkok roll ( it 's a fancy sushi roll ) .	1
A+++ hair and they really listen .	1
All were excellent .	1
The pad Thai , crazy noodles , Basel fried rice and sushi is the best anywhere .	1
Best haircut I 've ever gotten .	1
What a charming French restaurant !	1
She 's super sweet , strong , and knows exactly what your muscles need !	1
Would highly recommend this place ! !	1
Best Jamaican food in the burgh .	1
I highly recommend the one called `` Turtle ... '' at about $ 7-8/piece .	1
Only complaint , they need to vary the daily specials from time to time and need to bring back braciola in the winter as promised !	1
This was to die for .	1
My caprese salad was divine with some of the best fresh mozzeralla I have eaten since Rome and the selection of hairloom tomatoes - divine .	1
My get and legs feel great !	1
I saved money and my car looks amazing !	1
Kristen was awesome .	1
The service is good , the place is clean and the food is very tasty .	1
Definitely makes this place a bit more affordable .	1
The best ! !	1
But now with chef plate everything is an accurate portion !	1
Tile , grout and seal flooring was truly as good as it gets !	1
Definitely a must-visit if you 're in Urbana-Champaign and you value independent culture ; record stores like this are a dying breed and this is one of the best .	1
Located in the Scottsdale Quarter , this high end restaurant is a great place for dinner .	1
I highly recommend him and am so happy to make the 40 minute drive across town just to see him again .	1
5 stars	1
AMAZING !	1
Remembrance Day proved to be a great time to show up , we were the only ones in the joint and well taken care of .	1

John Werner is always available when I need him !	1
You 're the real MVP !	1

Everyone in the office is friendly , kind and knowledgeable .	1
Good place !	1
We opted for the Omakase Dinner for 2 and the chef created a beautiful platter based on our preferences .	1
It 's amazing !	1
Considering the culinary mecca that Vegas is supposed to be , I 've had limited success at finding really great food here .	0
Alex was very nice and did a great job .	1
Great Mexican restaurant I would go again ; )	1
I went with Samson 's Lox which was probably the best smoked salmon sandwich that I 've ever eaten .	1
Knowing that we wanted her a part of the ceremony and in pictures we needed to make sure she looked her absolute best !	1
They also have in house made French pastries that look amazing , ca n't wait to try those !	1

Delicious burgers .	1
I routinely like NY pizza thin foldable kind better but would definitely go back for this Chcago Style pizza ..	1
Brandon was an amazing help .	1

The restaurant is very spacious , there are a lot of tables .	1
Amazing !	1
Glad such a beautiful spa is available on the east end of the city !	1
I love grapefruit juice , but only the bitter tasting kind .... not the sugary sweet kind .	1

the food is very good , although in recent years the portions have gotten smaller .	1
Great coffee and great atmosphere .	1
Best wax experience .	1
This place has some great breakfast options and service is very good .	1
Excellent .	1
Every coca-cola souvenir you can think of , and you can still just grab a bottle of coke : )	1
The Chicago dog was very tasty , good sausage - but the bun to meat ratio seemed a bit off .	1
Toppings are always plentiful and taste fresh .	1
The menu is huge .	1
Steak was cooked perfectly and so were the prawns .	1
Great little Mexican restaurant if you live on Sunrise Mountain !	1
The price is excellent for the quality you receive .	1
Soooooo good !	1
The chicken was moist and tender .	1
If you have n't been yet give it a go , bonus is that you can always find a coupon for bogo entrees or a Groupon .	1
I understand that less often does mean more when it comes to carefully selected cheeses , and I was not expecting an `` all-you-can-eat '' trough of the stuff .	0
So worth it !	1
The patio is amazing and has cozy fire places .	1
I could have just stopped here and I would have been perfectly satisfied .	1
Lobster ravioli was also 5/5 , huge pieces of lobster with great flavors .	1
I 'm not usually one to browse gift shops but they did have quite a few items available that were very cool !	1
Something for everyone !	1
I had no idea this place dad here but it 's delicious .	1
He enjoys when he 's able to get out and run around like a dog parks and other places .	1
Oh , the weeknight happy hour specials are also great !	1
We gambled here this weekend and enjoyed ourselves .	1
They were very professional .	1
For appx $ 6.50 you get a sweet sugar waffle with all the toppings you can dream of including but not limited to Nutella , cookie butter , strawberries , bananas , and six different ice cream flavors .	1
The person there was very helpful in recommending juices for various uses .	1
I only wish it had come while I lived there .	1
Dropped in here today with a friend , we are in town for 2 days , we had a great workout .	1
Beautiful atmosphere ! !	1
The patio was small but very well shaded and I look forwarded to going back and trying their dinners as well as the happy hour .	1
Leurs bières brassée sont excellentes et il offre aussi des bières d'autre brasseurs .	1
Stopped in for lunch and was promptly greeted with a smile .	1
Fresh and warm and so buttery .	1
The pork chop dish is the best .	1

I just wrapped up my Invisalign treatment with Dr. Price , and I could n't be happier .	1
My favorite food there was the chicken shawarma has such good flavor and was very very sad that they were not open .	1

they were even accommodating with split checks .	1
The Red Chili fry bread was awesome !	1
Keep up the good work !	1
There is plenty of room to spread out and you do n't feel hurried out at any point .	1
I got my hair done my Kass Howard who did an amazing job !	1
Its soooo good you wont be disappointed ! ! !	1
There were also some Master Gardeners answering questions .	1
If they could offer a tastier version for the vegans or vegetarians that are lactose intolerant then I would def make this place a regular stop .	1
They offer pastries and kombucha as well .	1
Another great NOSH Tasting Tour !	1
Simple menu with amazing flavors .	1
Great chiropractic care here .	1
The burgers are very filling and it 's hard not to get messy when eating .	1
Situated on the center of the strip , the club is classy and the crowd makes you feel at home .	1
Hints of ( But not overdone ) truffle , crunchy rice bits , and the homemade XO sauce were key .	1
Music is n't too loud , not too crowded ( though they just opened ) , and tables are spacious .	1
She listens to you and actually provides feedback on whether she thinks a particular style will look good on you .	1
The people here are honest , hard working , and always provide excellent service on my vehicle .	1
He was very patient and took care of everything !	1
Stopped in for lunch and was really happy we did .	1
I was so happy to find Cindy from yelp .	1
But grilled bread , yummy salad and gooey eggs are always in fashion here at E2 and in my book .	1
Some of my favorites are the pancakes , spinach power bowl and the salmon quinoa bowl .	1
After that you can play unlimited arcade games .	1
Very impressed with his HONESTY and knowledge .	1
So now for penny 's I can enjoy this any time with my own toppings : )	0
The service was great and the food has never disappointed .	1
I always know she makes my brows look great !	1
If you 're famished , the tongue sandwich on brioche is soft and buttery .	1

I got the mimosa trip with 3 choices of juice ( pineapple , blood orange , raspberry ) .. Place is inviting and service is great ..	1
We had an amazingly delicious and decadent meal which have made us want to go back for more .	1
We started with the grand shellfish tower , which was great - we even had the oysters , although I could have used two shots with the two I had ( not a connoisseur of oyster ) .	1
There is a loop that you can drive that is a beautiful drive .	1
There are wooded trails along with the paved sidewalks and trails .	1
We visited late ( 9 pm ) on a Tuesday night , and had a great meal ; Hot and Sour soup , BBQ pork fried rice , shrimp with snow peas , and Stewed Pork Rib .	1
Whenever I go out for a sit-down meal , the service is something that I always appreciate .	1
No regrets ...	1
But also , it feels like the bike shop version of Cheers , he always remembers my name and rewards loyal customers .	1
The interior of the shop was ho-hum , but very clean and well kept .	1
They can also order most new books for you at 25 % off the publisher 's list price .	1
He was able to work with us and get us a great deal on our mattress and accessories .	1
I would highly recommend Green Chili to anyone in the neighborhood but would not drive across the city for it .	1
I thoroughly enjoyed my spicy ramen and rice but was overly stuffed .	1
I 'll certainly continue to frequent Craftsman and I do n't hesitate to bring guests , but there are certainly better options in Madison if you 're willing to drive a little further into town and maybe pay a little more .	1
I 'm not sure whether or not they are still listed as a place you can visit for free at the Phoenix Public Library or Mesa Public Library , but if they have a Cultural Pass for it , I would definitely check it out !	1
Their sausages are great for grilling .	1
The tape maze is super cool .	1
Nice and tucked away at good old Tempe Marketplace !	1
I feel like there cheeseburger was the best I have had out in a long while , and the smoother chicken was delicious .	1
They are also pretty good cold , which is great because you will have leftovers .	1
( for me the Ranch had me hooked , and I do n't really like Ranch as a rule ! )	1
The staff was super nice , friendly , and family owned .	1
We were in awe with the gorgeous views when we arrived .	1
Such excellent service !	1
The scorpion shot was the strangest , but coolest thing I 've ever seen .	1
We are all eaters and I know they will love it !	1
Its quiet , my neighbors are friendly , the kids seem to be well mannered and play well together outside , the staff is so friendly and helpful , and our community is just an overall good and safe place to come home to .	1
Delicious smooth , soft shave ice !	1
The crab dumpling appetizer is to die for !	1
One of the best curries I have tried so far .	1
A Tempe staple !	1
Sometimes it 's amazing , sometimes it 's just good .	1
Oh and I recently found out they had food here , I got a sandwich of some kind and it was pretty good actually but I usually get food across at like Cornish Pasty cause it is perfect to pair with drinking lol .	1
Although the presentation and general looks of the baklavas were top notch , they stopped short ( not that short ) from delivering the sweet punch I was looking for .	1
We had some type of banana dessert with ice cream , and although the chocolate was very hard to cut through , it was a perfect dessert .	1
I 've always cut them myself because no one had ever gotten them perfect but she took her time and made sure they were even and they turned out absolutely perfect !	1
Will be back for sure .	1
Great prices as well .	1
Small menu of bar food with some great selections ( couple sushi selections , skewers of assorted meats/fish ) - and some not so healthy options ( various fried foods ) .	1
Marvelous Indian food , great portions .	1
Our fears were unfounded - it was very casual and the staff was very friendly .	1
The surprising thing , it 's very reasonably priced .	1

I love it !	1
5 stars as far as general stores go .	1

I had the veggie burger and it was really good !	1
Their burgers are quite good as well- they are HUGE !	1

The atmosphere is sort of antique meets retro with lots of eclectic items and mirrors on the walls .	1
This is also my first choice for dining out with my family .	1
The meat is so good and high quality !	1
The pool is a great respite from the rest of the city and the service is impeccable ( although seemed to be a lot of families so maybe not the best place for a bachelor party ) .	1
I will definitely be back to check out a few other menu items soon .	1
From the orchestra to a couple of live Matt Good acoustic shows , conferences to a more recent Video Games Live , there 's not a bad seat , or a bad sound in the place .	1
Fresh , clean delicious goodies with gluten free bread options ( the good kind- not dry or cardboard like ) .	1
So glad we found this awesome new refurbished restaurant .	1

The nachos over exceeded our expectations , so I have to give credit where credit is due .	1
It was pretty fantastic , and the fact that we got a bean deep with it was a very nice surprise !	1
Chris replaced an outdoor hose bib for me .	1
I 'm really happy with my experience .	1
I miss the service i get from her because it was the best ! !	1
Never mind that I have a profound love for cheese curds and gravy ladled over potato skin french fries but then you throw on some pork ( my favourite meat ) and mushrooms ( my favourite veg/fungus ) ?	1
The dough is made daily , the sauce tastes fantastic and the guys working here are so down to earth .	1
Would definitely come back to try their other selections !	1
I 'll definitely be back at least once a week to try the rest of their sandwiches and their entrees .	1
Ca n't wait to return !	1
I also got to try the donuts and they were fantastic !	1

The biscuits and gravy are delicious !	1
The accompanying almond granola topping provided a subtle sweetness that I craved .	1

Luckily we were able to catch the infestation fairly quickly !	1
It was fried perfectly ; I just wish there was even some pepper at a minimum in the batter for flavor and taste .	1
The soup was perfect , right amount of salty , sweet , and savoury .	1
We ordered their milk tea with golden bubbles and it was delish .	1
They have a full bar and the beer list is n't extensive but is rotating with a nice variety .	1
Costed a little more than $ 10 for my cheesburger combo so it 's more expensive than most burger places , but it was a really great burger .	1
The food is always fresh , flavorful , and high quality .	1
Sat at the bar but the bar stools were a bit short so was n't the most comfortable seating , nevertheless was a great meal and cappuccino was the perfect ending .	1
He loved it and so did I. I loved how I got to watch him from home on my computer .	1
Clam chowder and seared tuna was also excellent .	1
I do n't have favourites , but I often choose the classes I go to based on music preferences ( most instructors ' classes are flavoured with the style of music they like to spin to , whether it be techo , latin-inspired , or Top 40 ) .	1

Honestly , the extra $ 10 bucks or so for the seafood buffet is worth it for seafood lovers who enjoy all types of seafood .	0
At Emporio , you will find simple yet delicious apps , salads , and a make-your-own meatball experience .	1
I 'm personally switching the mouth watering fried fish to a healthier grilled option .	1
Wonderful taste and Super great flavors ! !	1
Ca n't wait to go back and dine in .	1
It was soft and buttery and the spread on it was perfectly matched .	1
I have been to a lot of peruvian chicken places and this is by far the best one i 've been to .	1

My son 's first year at UNLV has been an amazing experience .	1

We ended up not buying the car , but if we were looking for a Volkswagen would definitely go here .	1
Ca n't go wrong .	1
We also had mussels with a mild curry sauce , which was quite delicious as well ( not too spicy , more of a thai curry flavour ) .	1
Favourite macarons included the pistachio , double passion fruit and champagne lemon .	1
The Japanese curry is stick and creamy in texture but still getting that hint of spice ( you can get it spicier if you want ) .	1

It 's located right next to the galleria mall and has giant signs , so you ca n't really miss it .	0
The paperwork is extensive because it is extremely thorough , and 30 minutes is n't adequate for completion if your history covers many years and/or numerous treatments .	1

Her work is beautiful and you can tell from her pictures that she has an incredible passion for what she does .	1

Time limit of 90min ( plenty of time ) OVERALL : 4 stars .	1
Starting with attentive service , then truly the best margarita I 've ever tasted -- I especially like the prickly pear one , but all are good .	1

The sausages , cheese , and breads are highly recommended .	1
Talk about # trendy - I 've become a HUGE fan of escape rooms since they 've gained popularity over the past year .	1
I went with the brisket sandwich on Challah , and it was super tasty !	1
The rooms are spacious and well appointed ( although showing just a little wear and tear ) and we never have heard noise from the hallways or from other guests .	1
We started with the tuna tartare with crispy rice .	1
Will be returning as soon as we can recover from price .	1
More than a handful of stray , missed hairs and a lack of lotion or balm after the procedure keeps this rating from a 5 , but so long as you can provide your own aftercare I would still highly recommend Jada Beauty .	1

I was staying at the hotel which is the Hyatt regency , and asked the concierge for a really good nice classy restaurant within the area .	1
If it 's really hot the roof closes , and they even have a swimming pool !	1
This Game Stop location is the best as they always seem to have what we need in stock , which is surprising considering it is located inside of a mall .	1
Not too expensive either .	1

Once we got inside and took the first bite of our soup we were convinced this is some of the best PHO in the city .	1
There are so many combinations , different proteins , bases , flavors , mix-ins , we could go here everyday and have a different meal everyday for a year .	1
You can expect to find a diverse menu , tasty baked goods , delicious chocolates , and a staff that is very friendly and courteous .	1
Tried a variety of tapas and all were delicious !	1
Called them , and we were very lucky that they were close by and was able to come within two hours .	1

They have the best peaking duck , ginger beef and dumplings .	1
It is so delicious , eggs , bacon , coffee , potatoes `` Awesome '' and the banana muffin is to die for !	1
Nothing necessarily mind blowing about Hank 's , but an excellent stop when you 're walking through Toronto .	1

Outside tables for seating it was great !	1
The fresh pita was warm and fluffy and I also loved the taboule on the side .	1
They have a dinner menu too ... featuring all sorts of seafood dishes ... but I only go for their great selections of oysters from around the world .	1
I ca n't wait to get back in the studio and learn and grow into my practice and listen to Ashley 's blessed voice !	1
The nightclubs there are dope ( I 've gone to Life on several occasions and Sayers Club has the dopest DJs . )	1
Destiny was great understanding my sugar intolerance , as I am a pain when my coffee is overly sweet !	1
Our server Jessie was wonderful and assisted us through the menu , daily specials and some history of the restaurant .	1

So much flavor in each dish , and always consistently great .	1
Those muffins were SOOOOO good !	1
Pancakes are always perfect , hash browns are delicious .	1
I 'm an Emerald Club member and renting a car from National as an Emerald Club member is fast and easy .	1
5 ENTHUSIASTIC STARS This is a large , well maintained botanical garden , teeming with birdlife and abundant in blooming cacti , succulents & other flowers .	1
They even occasionally will bring your food to your table ( I ca n't say if this is a standard practice or not , as it seems to strongly depend on how busy they are ) .	1
Really friendly place .	1
I never feel rushed - a great place to go out and hang out with friends , enjoy food and drinks !	1
They did a fantastic job with my order .	1
They get 5 stars for great food and great service .	1

-I did n't need to cook the whole brisket so he cut the brisket for me into a point and a flat and did a beautiful job getting the fat cap trimmed perfectly !	1
Although it tends to get a bit crowded on the weekends , the wait has never been interminable , usually 15-20 minutes or so .	1
The channa masala , specifically , is just amazing .	1
He is worth the drive no matter where you are in theValley .	1
Of course , I would not share the amazing sources with him because he can not have those sauces .	1
Never knew it had Latin influences .	1
The area became a wonderful place not just for tourists but for locals , too .	1
Will always come back ( :	1
I was greeted immediately , and was helped immediately by their associates .	1
Due to it 's proximity to work , I 'll probably be back a couple times a month and will try the green chile burro next since it smelled great .	1
They 've got a little bit of everything -- toys , strollers , pack-n-plays , clothes , high chairs , etc .	1
it was absolutely amazing , and rather filling .	1
I only wish I had an optometrist back home as great as him !	1

The establishment was very clean and organized .	1
Their sandwiches are huge , but definitely a little bit on the oily side .	1

for the price , Ichiban is a fantastic deal .	1
From the person answering the phone to the electrician that came out to our home , everyone was patient and courteous .	1
They were a large size and they did not skimp on the alcohol content either .	1
This is a must place to stop when in Vegas .	1
This was totally a pleasant experience , the venue looked airy and healthful , the service was great , and the food very satisfying .	1
But never fear , the Luxor came through and now i have gorgeous wedding pictures .	1
He loved it .	1
Wonderful environment- perfect temperature , clean everything , relaxing music -- these guys have it figured out .	1
I am lucky to have one of their friendly and smiling staffs to the rescue .	1

The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the coconut pairs perfectly with the horseradish dijon dipping sauce .	1
I ca n't wait to go back ! !	1
We shared some of the Sriracha Fries which were delicious .	1
The best dessert I 've had at Glutton is one that is n't on the menu .	1
They did make me really delicious spaghetti pomodoro , and charged a reasonable price ( less than any of their pasta dishes on the menu ) , but it would have been nice to be able to try something a bit more ... special .	1
Salads , yogurts and fruit , fresh squeezed juices .	1
It was that Delish !	1
I 'll miss their options on Library Mall -- sometimes I 'd feel like a little Italian , sometimes BBQ , sometimes something totally different .	1

We 'll probably go back for dinner next and try the lamb chop , which our waiter recommended highly .	1
If you want : 1 ) you want a simple manicure 2 ) you want it quick 3 ) you want it cheap Then I highly recommend Uni Hair and Nail Salon , because they do all these things in a clean and spacious environment .	1
The only downside - the cost ... its not cheap .	1
The flavors were delicious , the rolls could have been rolled a little bit tighter .	1
I am very grateful to have found Dr. Phillips .	1

The staff is always friendly and extremely hospitable .	1
There was an added cost for medication that the Groupon did not cover but other than that , I did not have any surprise charges and they were not pushy whatsoever in asking me about an additional service .	1
I moved to Las Vegas this year and the Islands here is Fantastic .	1
We tried their white pizza , which featured provolone , mozzarella , romano , ricotta cheeses & garlic .	1
The food is OK and the prices on the high side , but you are paying for the view and the experience and it is well worth it !	1
Service , portions , & prices are all spot on .	1
He was really friendly but also a great singer .	1
The most inviting factor in Gianfranco 's is the simplicity of its food .	1

Great spot to go with friends or on a date : )	1
In both cases the cuisine was imaginative and delicious .	1
The multiple tigers on the walls were my favorite !	1
In any case , they were both extremely helpful and knowledgeable about high quality foods , different price points to fit my budget and my desire to keep them on an all life stage food .	1
We tried a little something from each menu and highly recommend the following : spam steam bun ( I promise you will dig it !	1

The marbling made it really well balanced , though more subtle in flavor than the flatiron .	1
It 's so hard to get that a wine shop in Hawaii only let me touch and caress the bottle but not buy ) There is also a good selection of wines by the glass offered both in full and half pours to help with tasting .	1
Service was great and price point affordable .	1
With free Wi-Fi and a decent amount of table space it is my go-to space when I need to schedule a coffee meeting in the Southside .	1
Since the location is n't particularly busy yet there 's no line up for waiting rooms or cash register 's , which makes the shopping experience efficient and enjoyable .	1
Tashja recommended the truffle burger which was fantastic .	1
They also offer soft serve ice cream that I hear is really good .	1
Jo is the best at making martinis-try the Tiramisu & Shamrock one-it tastes exactly like those after dinner mint chocolates ( Andies ? )	1

I 've been to 3 Vietnamese places this past week , and this is by far the best .	1

They have also received the reader 's choice award multiple times as best Thai in the York region .	1

My favorite was the custom omelet station since I got to choose exactly what went into my omelet and I knew it was fresh .	1

The Bi Bim Bap and Bulgogi is so delicious .	1
This place was so awesome .	1
We highly recommend this restaurant .	1
Beans , rice , meat , and cheese create a great medley of flavours and textures on their own yet I 'm always surprised at how often Mexican places douse their food in generic taco seasoning which kills the natural flavour of everything in the burrito .	1
Definitely worth every penny for the delectable selections .	1
Outside seating and super friendly staff make it my new favorite place to stroll on weekend mornings !	1
Boy did I ever regret that decision .	0
It 's very clean inside and they have comfortable booths .	1
I highly recommend giving it a try .	1

Place is rather popular and it was quite busy , we are glad we stopped by and enjoyed their menu very much !	1

Their Xiao Long Bao is pretty good , ( not DTF good but better than a lot of other places ) and the service is quick and efficient .	1

If you are in the Charlotte/Rock Hill area and are looking for a top notch place to eat ( especially breakfast any time of day ) , drive on down Old Monroe and stop in at the Omega Coney Island .	1

Very full and happy	1
Definitely did not disappoint I 'm from California thought it was going to be a little different since the original one is in my hometown but come to surprise it was good place good music good entertainment and a lot of beautiful ladies	1

I love a good grilled cheese and the certainly know how to turn it into a gourmet meal .	1
The food here is delicious , but the prices are what makes this place such a rare find !	1
The only negative thing which I pointed out to them , was that the staff should be more attentive when they tag the items .	1
This is the place I first tried an Empanada , which is not a bad snack for the price ( $ 3.00 or so ) but then I can eat lots at times .	1
Love their Sunday brunch and drink specials .	1
Very nice , new facility with mutiple intersection spaces and loops , a really fun design .	1
First things first , I would recommend you bring along a friend who knows Korean if you do n't know yourself .	0

These macarons are $ 1.50 each and are a much better choice IMO than the ones at Patisserie Manon which is nearby , ALOHA ! ! !	1
I mean I went on a Saturday and always myself there the very next day , its just addicting .	1
Thank you M & J Cleaning service for your outstanding job .	1
Everyone from the hostess to the busser is extremely friendly and working to make your experience as enjoyable as possible .	1

I love their fried rice ( rice , egg , carrots , and peas ) .	1
Very inviting , open well-lit space , classes given , wide selection of cookbooks ; if there is something you want but it 's out of print , just ask the owner , Jonathan Cheung , and he 'll see if he can get it for you online .	1
Ca n't wait to come back for more work .	1
Park on Fremont on a slower night is the perfect place to be ! !	1

Just all around love this theater !	1
19,900 Calorie Burger - `` Fighting anorexia since 2005 '' - The Lowdown : This Grill is the equivalent to what Seth Rogan is to movies ; bad for you , but hilariously entertaining .	1
The bikinis had a mix of sizes ... and it just was n't the typical small - large ... they went by bra sizes all the way up to size G ... they cater to everybody .	1
On the other hand , their reasonable prices bring exceptional quality services into my `` snack bracket '' , which has never been the case before .	1
The kadayif was n't your typical baklava-style dessert .	1

The food is a tad pricey but they give you good-sized portions for the mains and the quality is quite good .	1
It 's one of the best dim sum place in town .	1
Lots of great products and they were super friendly and informative .	1
Keep up the good work everyone !	1
The green has more texture to it and is spicy and the red is a bit more viscous and not quite as spicy ; but both are good .	1
Endroit magique !	1
So so so so great .	1
I 'd give the whole restaurant 3.5 stars and round it up to 4 for the willingness of the owners to open an original restaurant in the land of chains .	1
I went on a Friday after work without an appointment and they were able to see me within 20 min which was great .	0
They also have live seafood in the tank at decent prices .	1

The waiter was amazing and Ryan Higgins is not hard on the eyes as well !	1
I will continue to return .	1
The reason this is not a 5 is because i believe you get more at kabuto for lower price and kabuto is outstanding .	1
You wo n't feel cramped staying at this place for long stretches of time , which will undoubtedly come clutch during exam season .	1
Still my favorite sushi place in Vegas !	1
I am grateful for your outstanding service .	1
It was beyond delicious and left me craving another variety .	1
Together , it was just right , not too sweet or rich .	1
I appreciate sports therapy available here .	1
Great music , friendly staff , real rock music .	1
Their pedicure stations are complete with spa style massage chairs , their waxing room is impecably clean , and their pink and whites get me compliments weeks after I get them done .	1
I was more than excited to enjoy the bottomless mimosas , and I was extremely satisfied with the chicken and waffles .	0
The food was great especially for a chain restaurant .	1
Salmon salad was good too ! !	1
Mixing the salsa and bean dip is a winner for me .	1
He really made our night amazing .	1
Even though Chris was as amiable & helpful as can be , there were still elements of `` salesiness '' ( I 'm coining that term ) that are inherent to the process .	1
but the wifi signal here 's great so i ca n't complain too much .	0
Loved the mini potato rounds and the dressing on the side salad was very nice .	1
I love this place because it is ridiculously cheap and the food is pretty descent .	1

Everything works and I have never had a problem with any machines you literally see these girls that work here walking around with a cart full of clean water wiping and cleaning all the machines and the floor always clean !	1
We also picked up some filets , chorizo and pollo as well .	1
The DJ was a great mix master and kept the party going all night .	1
What a great golf course !	1
They 're not pushy , or quick and not afraid to let you leave the store - they know you 'll be back !	1
The space is beautiful and very clean .	1
Cette fromagerie est excellente : très grand choix , qualité et service .	1
i hate it when places do that - you need to keep it consistent !	1

They also offer you bread to start and its it was to die for just the right amount of sweet and it melts it was so soft to the touch it practically melts in your mouth .	1
The sweet shrimp with the fried head is a must !	1
Make a reservation , try the Pillsbury Diva and Enjoy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
But if you find yourself at the mall and craving some Pho , definitely check this place out !	1

This is such a loving heartfelt establishment and they make sure to pick out the truest genuine individuals to work here .	1

Toppings are yummy and staff is always friendly .	1
Great company to work with !	1
Everything was delicious and fresh .	1
The whole family enjoyed everything we ordered .	1
I also really like the smaller pieces , with a whole chicken being about a dozen individual pieces , since that raises the crunchy batter-to-chicken ration , which is all good by me !	1
The service was great and the food was superb .	1
The Buffet hands down a nicer ambiance !	1
Wow what an awesome place !	1
The staff is amazing as well .	1

The guaspacho thrilled my tongue , and the butternut squash ice cream was great .	1
come here if you want tex-mex style food - meaning LOTS of cheese on their rice and beans , good guac , and great salsa	1
For those that are more adventurous , durian milkshake is actually really yummy .	1

The owner Shannon is a wealth of knowledge .	1
I 'm fully reasonable in my expectations for an all night taco shop that has been serving our intoxicated community for many many years , and have always been a big fan , but I believe the real issue at this location is the service .	0
The daily specials at this restaurant never disappoint !	1
The wings are amazing as is the poke is the best I 've had in a while !	1
Trying to aim for the different colors and get more points made it an exciting way to stay entertained .	1

I give it 4.5 stars .	1
Rai Lay is definitely a change from most Thai places - to start , it 's a bit more modern .	1
Always a great time !	1

The Yellowtail Sushi Rolls and the Black Cod are some of the best fish I 've had .	1
I have wisdom teeth than need to be removed and have been in need of a dentist that would help me feel comfortable and at ease .	1
Dr. G and the staff are very warm and welcoming .	1
They do n't carry the ones I wanted so they had them custom ordered , it was so easy to work with their staff .	1
The chicken was again cooked just right and the sauce complimented both it and the seasoned mashed potatoes wonderfully .	1
Everyone raves about Monta , which is located a stone throwaway from Zen , but I believe Zen is leaps and bounds better of the two Japanese restaurant in this shopping complex .	1
You can pick up really good stuff there and bring it back .	0
For dessert , we shared a guava chiffon cake .	1
5 years ago , girls got in free !	1
the small rare beef pho is $ 6.99 and i feel like you get more beef , and at what seems like double the noodles ... ( skimping on the noodles is my # 1 complaint about pho hung ) .	1
I got to La Prima every weekend ! !	1
She is gentle and can make your nail dreams come true !	1
Breakfast , dinner , pastries even the iced tea is great .	1

You wo n't regret it !	1
They did a great job .	1
Margaritas are yummy yummy with 1800 .	1

* * BBQ House is a Stellar Experience !	1
Great place to eat due to a variety of items on the menu ( breakfast/lunch/dinner ) that taste good , open 24hrs , and always there for you .	1
Caprese salad was light and refreshing .	1
My only complaint is they are so busy it took forever to get a refill and the check .	1
I 'm a little disappointed they discontinued the kids menu because that was the perfect portion size for a light lunch but I guess I 'm not a kid so I should n't complain !	1
I love to sit out on their patio and grab a beer on a warm summer night !	1

We shared the deviled eggs , chicken skins , veal meatballs , cauliflower and beet salad- the perfect portions for a group of 5 and a not so heavy dinner before a night of b-day celebrations .	1
What an amazing , well balanced , slightly fruit tasting ale this was .	1
I can only say that this is a truly romantic getaway if just for one night .	1
I must say , the staff AND patrons here were insanely nice .	1
All in all , a positive experience !	1
Loved the variety of items on the menu .	1
Not a big variety but they have options and some good quality steaks .	1
I love Club Tanning !	1
We told our amazing waitress that if the cost went up a bit so that the chef could deviate and give us some adventurous options , we would be up for that .	1

Excellent eats and drinks .	1
Because of this knowledge , he was able to suggest a color that totally personifies me .	1
STK is not your typical steakhouse !	1
Between all of the paths , green houses , and gazebos , it 's easy to get lost and lose track of time in this nature wonderland stuck between the concrete jungle outside .	1

I love this place .	1
the inside was very clean and a nice place to chat and eat , kind of reminds me of a Jamba Juice , but more modern ?	1
Thanks for the perfect presentation of a handsomely sealed bag .	1
Very clean and modern ! !	1
The menu has a nice array of options ( mostly meat driven but that 's to be expected ) and it 's not too big which I actually like because in most circumstances that means they do what they do well .	1
Pure heaven .	1
As for the Shack Stack , there 's really not much else for me to say other than it 's still delicious especially with that fried cheese stuffed portobello inside .	1
The service was definitely deserving of 4 stars , but the food ... not so much .	0
After being told it was an hour wait at Postinos we decided to try My Wine Cellar and we 're so glad we did !	1

I love their donuts .	1
They have the usual bowling alley stuff - pool tables , arcade games , a pro shop and snack bar .	1
Myke did an awesome and thorough job with our chimney .	1
The shop definitely caters to anyone that wants to take photos of their treats with a neon phrase ( what a catch ) , a decorative flower wall , and designated walls with lighting .	1
You also ca n't beat $ 2 domestic pints all weekend .	1
Ive been coming to this buffet for decades now and the quality is still worth the price .	1
It seems like this is a happening place , besides hosting local food truck roundups they also seem to promote local live music and art .	1
First time here very Beautiful ! !	1
Tori does an excellent job on our dogs every time ! !	1

A little pricey but I 'd est there again ... well worth it ! And our waiter Andre was as pleasant and wonderful.Not your regular burger place ... the three c 's ... classy , clean , and courteous !	1
I would definitely return .	1
Both pizza 's were very favorable !	1

Very customer friendly place .	1
I did n't feel awkward at all during my yearly mole check , which was a major plus !	1
The service was great as well .	1
You could get thoroughly stuffed for $ 30 or less but if you go all out , you can easily spend $ 50-60 per person .	1
My husband had the Santa Cruz skillet which was delicious as well .	1
It was fluffy and flavorful , and I would have been happy just eating that all night .	1
For example , the roasted corn has a nice layer of cheese , seaweed and mayo sauce over a lighty roasted sweet corn on a cob while the tofu and avocado was kinda like a cold refreshing salad .	1
You ca n't really beat the price if you are looking for a fast and hearty turkey dinner .	1

This is a wonderful place I will continue to get my haircut at .	1
The pork belly was DROOL worthy .	1
The soup and egg is my favorite part	1
They 're a great team n I appreciate their enthusiasm and loyalty .	1
I think the reason why they can guarantee the lowest prices is because they see a lot of patients and they have a very efficient process and setup .	1
Gemini is that oasis in this desert .	1
Service was outstanding Kendall was super ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
My deconstructed salmon bagel was awesome .	1
Thanks again , great job !	1
Major kudos to the gentleman working there !	1

I do n't have a whole lot to say about this place other than the fact that it 's a must try for Portuguese chicken in Montreal , I always find myself comparing other places to it to see if they can match the deliciousness that is Romados !	1
Open until midnight and the portions are BIG !	1
They offer teas , smoothies , coffees , shaved ice treats and small appetizers .	1
Large and tender shrimp and lobster !	1
Lots of wealthy suburbanites with fancy watches , cool shoes and expensive haircuts are the main clientele .	1
This of course was with dessert , ca n't skip that : ) I recommend the pulled pork and the lemon cake or pecan brownie for dessert .	1
fk St. Louis bar !	0

You will find knowledgeable staff who enjoy beer and enjoy sharing their wealth of beer knowledge to help you find the perfect brew .	1
Went here a while ago on a road trip from Texas to Los Angeles !	1
Love Scooter 's !	1
Mike treated my parents like his own parents , with kindness and respect .	1
The beers are all pretty sour which I typically associate with gose style beers ( which I think are German sour beers ) but they call theirs wild , I believe , and these are more French and Belgian .	1
Asian pear mojito and extra spicy pad Thai are my faves .	1
The turkey bialy is one of my favorites .	1
All three were really good , but my favorite was the tomato blue crab .	1
We had the lamb chop special , out of this world cooked perfectly .	1
Mmm ...	1
Keep it up guys !	1

Will definitely come back for another .	1
The food was very good , cost effective , and the location is right in the middle of everything .	1
I enjoyed it as a first timer .	1
Seems a bit steep for a cookie , but after sampling it I can say that it was worth every penny .	1
They also have a live dj on weekends spinning mostly old school hip hop and rock .	1
Went here for my first time today because I have been doing a detox cleanse so a fresh drink was necessary .	0

I have spoken with Jay , he was extremely helpful !	1
Fluffy on the inside and went well with the whipped butter that had a touch of sweetness .	1
This establishment has perfected the art of cooking ribs along with fast friendly service .	1
One of the best creme brûlée I 've ever had - it truly rivals those of the best Parisian restaurants and cafes .	1
Definitely the best ramen and Japanese food you can get in Cleveland .	1
They have homemade curly fries , too .	1
Great beer selection , great good .	1
Cleveland Hardwood Restoration did an amazing job on our floors !	1
Maha 's is one of Toronto 's hidden gem and worth the trek to the east side of the city .	1

Connecticut Lobster Roll , yum .	1
Barrio Queen has a full bar and also offers the usual line of sodas as well as many Mexican choices .	1
Service was great too - every table was full and people kept rolling in , but the employees were very efficient and the wait for our food was not long .	1
I would highly recommend ordering this when you come here for brunch .	1
F & E is really convenient because it is open 24 hours , I just wish they were closer !	1
The kale salad was perfectly dressed and delicious .	1
Great park .	1
Would recommend even as a destination spot .	1
Indoor ski ball , pool , darts , and corn hole outside as well .	1
I will admit , the place is a bit pricey , but this place is great !	1
It is always SPOTLESS and clean , the employees always greet me with a smile and a kind hello .	1

Favorite place to eat in vegas .	1
I was n't disappointed !	1
It is original and I hope locals flock back to this place and give it a try instead of going to their usual chain restaurant faves , all of which can be found within a 2-mile radius of Honey Salt !	1
wide seating , prompt and warm service and obviously amazing food still resonates in my soul and stomach several months later .	1
Will definitely be coming back !	1
Amazing Icecream ...	1

The next time I come here I 'm trying the country fried steak !	1
I wish I could because it looks like it 's bomb .	1
Overall I like it and will keep going back : )	1
But you are quite likely to find me there devouring a veggie bowl with lots and lots of corn salsa on a Monday afternoon .	1
The crust was so good - light and buttery !	1
But I do n't think anyone has mentioned their other star dish , the 'Miu Ling Roasted Squab ' it is so tender , juicy & delicious !	1
The line was long on a Sunday night but well worth the wait !	1
It was crisp and flavorful served on a chilled plate which is a nice detail .	1
Check out the size of this monster cookie !	1
I love all of the artists , and I find them all very talented .	1
It was the perfect amount of coconut , not super overpowering and sweet and the ice cream was so creamy .	1
Enjoy dinning in , fast service even when they look busy !	1
So I got this raspberry bomb , and let me tell you , it was so good , it brought me back to my childhood when my mom used to add alcohol to my Kool Aid to try to get me to go to sleep .	1
Luv u guys !	1
BF got some cashew vegetarian and the sauce was flavorful and delicious .	1
The bed was very comfortable and room was a good size .	1
A great information resource as well ... trainers , groomers , etc .	1
They have music on the weekends and with the weather cooling down , it 's perfect !	1
The heat was good , not overbearing as to mask the flavor of the pan roast , but enough so that I left sweaty and snorting fire .	1
I live very close and it seems decently busy quite often but I 'm still able to get a table or seat at the bar .	1
This place is worth making the trip .	1
Those cupcakes are tasty !	1
The exhibits are interesting and informative .	1
The food was presented beautifully and the staff has that great Vegas vibe with excellent advice about food choices .	1

The buffet dinner was fantastic , especially with unlimited beer and wine .	1
The Chicken Tikka Masala was so good we had to order a second round .	1
Excellent work , quality service , honesty , and integrity .	1
But do n't forget to try other things , like the ginger snapper or the duck pad kee mao , both yummy !	1
My girlfriend and I eat sushi quite often , so we ordered our favorite nigiri ( sake , hamachi , kampachi , toro- chu , spicy scallop ) and a spicy tuna and rainbow roll to compare .	1
Not only do I enjoy trying out the standard sushi fare at every restaurant ( I 'm a dyed-in-the-wool spicy scallop nigiri fan ) but also adventurous enough to sample specialties of the house .	1
Fsntastic , awesome , well organized .	1
On my second visit I decided to order the pernil burrito , the chipotle salsa was a perfect combination with the pernil and sweet cabbage .	1
The restaurant was kind and gracious in helping resolve the matter .	1
Great time !	1
It 's a bit separated from the rest of the islands , so remember to pack a picnic .	1
And finally , a thank you to Eddie .	1

First of all , the service was fantastic .	1

The first time , I got a french manicure that she drew the tips freehand , and I could n't believe how perfect it was .	1
Our waiter was knowledge and attentive and kept bringing extras - sorbet to cleanse our palettes , dessert , and limoncello .	1
She is just delightful and full of energy and sunshine and our home sparkles-literally .	1
The food was great and will not disappoint .	1
She can whip out your acrylics in no time AND the craftsmanship is incomparable !	1
Just a little downfall for a great place .	1
I love their presentation .	1
Four stars for bringing a modestly-priced , casual but legit sushi place to downtown Phoenix .	1
Orecchiette and sausage pasta was simple , but great and probably my favorite thing .	1
I trained with Jake who was phenomenal !	1
I ca n't say enough about how happy I am with my results !	1
You 're also given an amuse bouche ( croquette with soup shooter ) and a goodbye gift ( banana muffins ) .	1
We all especially enjoyed the lo mien and the orange chicken .	1
So first off-the meatball spring roll with the crunchy piece of eggroll skin is heavenly , plus that crab dip ? !	1
tasty !	0
It 's an old school kind of place - class and charm without a hint of novelty or reliance on anything other than the food .	1
We will definitely be back !	1
Great place to watch the games , grab some super delicious craft beers and enjoy one of their amazing specials .	1
It does n't come with many ingredients but that 's what I love about it , simple and delicious .	1

They all were excellent -- fresh crust not too thick and the dough had been allowed to rise properly .	1
Yum ! !	1
This place is by far the best gourmet burger joint I 've had yet !	1
Then I moved right on over to the vegetable pakora which did n't disappoint with the light and spicy batter ( both integral mint chutney moments here , people ) .	1
Sometimes , the hot food bar is mediocre ( I usually skip it ) , and sometimes the fried items get dry -- such is the nature of a buffet , but the sushi is a-okay and never dry or weird .	1
Both were the best steaks I 've ever had !	1
I 'm partial to their burgers , but you really ca n't go wrong with anything on the menu .	1

They carry all kinds of classy , fun , extraordinary pieces that you can mix and match everyday of the week or season .	1
Very expensive but is above and beyond any gym in Phoenix including lifetime fitness in my opinion .	1
I usually do n't like clubs but this one gets 5 stars from me and would get more if I could give them .	1

Bathrooms were spotless , and the drink counter was very well kept .	1
Now , the CREAM FILLING now that was DELISH !	0
I definitely want to try their pizzas next !	1
They have you step onto a pad that reads your foot pressure so they can suggest shoes and insoles based on evening out those pressure points .	1
My feet feels amazing and my back is now relaxed .	1

OMG it was so good .	1
Once we eat the rest of the meat and eggs we already have at home , we will definitely be back to get some chorizo , lamb , and eggs .	1
It was a cloudy day , and a bit cold , so a perfect day to have some sort of insight experience and the musical instrument museum did not disappoint .	1

The office staff was energetic and friendly .	1
It was a great experience ; I had the MVP Experience which included a haircut , neck and shoulder massage , shampoo and a hot towel .	1
Ichiriki can be a bit hard to spot being nestled in amongst the grey slather of office buildings near Church and Bloor but it is well worth searching out as it serves dependable , honest Japanese cuisine .	1

The food at Babbo was top notch and levels above what Olive Garden delivers .	1

The volcano roll was definitely rich , the waikiki was a very straight forward but fresh , and the salmon and scallop had a great semi-spicy sauce .	1
This place is awesome !	1
In the fall of 2011 , I was 7 years into my tenure as a Bank of America customer and for the most part was perfectly content with my membership .	1
Portions were huge and the manager was extremely helpful with answers to our questions and made menu recommendations that were spot on .	1
They also have croissants , brownies , sandwiches , etc .	1
As a first time homebuyer , Chris 's highly impressive local knowledge and willingness to explain the process made buying my first home a great experience .	1
Super service , endroit sublime , bref j'adore !	1
I ordered a peameal bacon benedict and hubby ordered a big breakfast with everything ( sausage , bacon , ham , egg , pancake and french toast ) The portion is really big and I love their potato .	1
But any who the place is very clean and welcoming and the tech is so nice , makes you feel really comfortable !	1
Breakfast is the best !	1
( sorry to make you sad ) The staff and doctors were so supportive and caring it made it as easy as it could be for a parent at such a difficult time .	1
They also accomdate and take care of my friend a lot ( he 's ratchet ) I love love love you guys !	1
surprisingly one of the best almond croissants i can say i have ever had !	1
There is also very convenient covered parking .	1
I would definitely stay here again depending on the price and would recommend it to others as well .	1
Really good food !	1
This is easily my new favorite ice cream spot in NE Ohio .	1
Oh man .. this place hit the spot for everyone !	1
Nevertheless , i loved the flavours .	1
I totally recommend the BLT roll amazingggg .	1
Been here a few time and always friendly and more importantly good food .	1
Service is wonderful and you can tell the owners and chefs have a passion for what they do .	1
It comes in a traditional french onion bowl and has french onion soup with Foie Gras mixed in to add some kick to that traditional flavor .	1
I 'll definitely be going back , it delivered beyond expectations , and it 's a good local joint .	1
Favorite drink is the caramelo latte , but it 's seasonal so hurry in !	1
The wait staff is very professional and knows how everything is prepared on their menu .	1
Our waitress was amazing , she helped us pick our meal from their very exotic and interesting menu .	1
This small business provides great service and does quality work .	1
Carrot Cake - most and delicious .	1
I 've seen a party pedaler or two in my time , and have always wanted to try it out -- such a blast !	1
All the bartenders were friendly and attentive .	1
And $ 6 for one ( small ) meatball !	1
Thank you Jackie and Team Valiente for helping us find our perfect home !	1
He tried a new technique for the feathers which I will admit , got me a little worried , but regardless the outcome was amazing .	1
overall four relaxing & fun days spent in Vegas .	1
Had a great hint of mustard and a nice soft hint of heat .	1
Do n't let that deter you , though , the food was great .	1
Wow ... this is by far the best Fry 's I 've been to and the best grocery store I 've been to since moving here .	1
The sliders are awesome because you can get three different kinds at once .	1
: )	1
We 'll be back !	1
( 45 ) The sushi was had great proportion of rice to fish unlike many other places and the rolls I thought were already pretty big ( it gets better ) and the sashimi cuts were superb !	1
Interior design is nice and you feel very comfortable .	1
Escape Reality saved the day !	1
Best of all , the portion is large and fills you up rather quickly .	1
Now , I never did well in anatomy or any other science class in college , but once inside , I found the exhibit simply fascinating .	1
I initially tried Frankie 's because it 's walking distance from my house ; I keep coming back to Frankie 's because their food is soooooo gooooood .	1
I would definitely recommend at least trying the Waffle Cristo once !	1
The service was very friendly and helpful when answering questions regarding the menu items .	1

The tempura was perfect !	1
The brunch pre-fix included your choice of breakfast cocktails , appetizer , entree , and amazing still steaming home made muffins and mint chocolate scones .	1

Same love and care go into the burritos here as they do at the downtown locations .	1
The food is also really good !	1
Everyone is welcoming .	1
He took a bit of my heckling before making me a gorgeous cappuccino .	1
Sufficient tv to watch a leafs game , which they also have food and drink specials when televised .	1
Little expensive but to me a good massage with a good masseuse is worth it .	1
Bright white decor , high ceilings , open concept , lots of seating for couples or for groups .	1
But as the Yelp rating system states , 5 stars means `` As good as it gets ! ''	1
Amelia was great , I will definitely become a regular	1
THANKS Alan Karp & BMW Las Vegas !	1

The menu is definitely for chocolate lovers !	1
The place was busy and the service was fast and top notch .	1

This place is completely unique and the food is very good .	1
Such a great little place .	1
Service could be better but the food is completely worth it .	1
Are they going under some renovations , yes , but only because the theaters are being upgraded to super awesome lounging chairs !	1

All in all , book your stay here because you wo n't be disappointed .	1
Outdoor seating is a plus .	1
Leah 's team made the experience very easy .	1
Good food takes time and the key is having everything made upon order and not a month prior ... One overlooked item is Yia yia 's Pastitsio and it is amazing ! !	1
They 're quite effective !	1
I had a fantastic experience .	1
I would highly recommend Dr. Luzod in resolving any pain issues .	1
Not much for dessert options which was probably for the best for my waistline !	1

They also have one free week for new girls who want to try it ! !	1
So good ! !	1
It 's a nice dining room with lots of natural wood .	1

Now I have had many things at this restaurant , but I will say that their steaks are amazing .	1
The person at the counter was very accommodating and helpful as well , and everything went as planed .	1
Our favourite go to restaurant !	1
Match is a really cool happy hour spot or date night even .	1
Add a skinny acai lemonade .... yummy .	1
Restaurants do n't get it sometimes ... business is so competitive that they must go the extra mile ( or in this case 20feet ) for the guest !	0
The portions are bigger than your normal restaurant inside an old folks community .	1
( bacials , specialized facials for mature , oily , sensitive , acne/problem skin ) The spa room was relaxing , clean , and very inviting .	1
Jeff was so sweet and checked in on us as well .	1
I almost wish that we did n't have dinner reservations because the food menu looked delicious !	1
A good measure of a service business is how they handle situations like this , and we highly recommend Oasis Spa and Salon !	1
Definitely worth trying if you 're into pizza ... and if you 're not !	1
Fantastic service !	1
All of them are delicious !	1
They always have interesting specials and seasonal offerings that keep the menu dynamic .	1
I am so happy that Avondale Safelite is my insurance 's preferred installer but I would use them even if they were n't .	1

Most of the servers know the menu in and out , can offer suggestions , are very friendly , and accommodating .	1
Thank you !	1
I 've been here twice with coworkers and I love it .	1
I liked it !	1
Priced by weight , a great stop after retail therapy at Saks or dessert after Stingray Sushi or True Food at the Biltmore .	1
The chicken was cooked perfectly and I loved the concept of polenta waffles , but they were a bit dry even with the honey on top .	1
needless to say , still 5 stars ! ! ! !	1

This place is very good !	1
If you are a seafood eater , this place is awesome !	1
Bone marrow was n't my favorite and it did n't come with noodles , so if I were to return , I would get a different special pho , and the oxtail fried rice again ; ) And definitely do n't skip out on their dessert !	1
The overall dining experience was so perfect that we made reservations for dinner the next night , but the second time we sat outside with the view of the Bellagio fountain .	1

Perfect size for those of us trying to keep our girlish figures !	1
Super spicy , super tasty !	1

They were very nice and very accommodating with reasonable prices .	1
I usually get the Original - roast beef , cheddar and horseradish spread .	1
Gelato is homemade so flavours will change and can depend on fruits in season .	1
They had a beautiful selection of cakes , pastries and macaroons but unfortunately not much caught my eye .	1
Food is always good , service is friendly .	1
I live right down the street from Next Door Brewery and its proximity is delightful !	1
It was so tender and juicy !	1
So this cafe fills a few important niches : 1 ) copious seating .	1
The meats are always seasoned very tasty .	1
Also a side of pork belly , buffalo fried cauliflower ( so good ! )	1
So aside the bricked streets and the condo towers nearby , the District has a number of restaurants , cafes , art stores , galleries , jewellery store , heck , a furniture store and even a theatre .	1
The fried calamari was light and delicious , but I 've never had bad fried calamari .	1
The pool is very well maintained and the staff here are friendly .	1
I dont normally like chai 's but this one was the best I 've tasted .	1

) , they actually have vegetarian options , and a decent selection of beer ( they have Murphy 's Red on tap - as opposed to the very common Smithwicks , which is pretty unique ) .	1
I ordered the Butter Corn Ramen and was very tasty .	1
Flavor wise it was delicious , the spicy mayo they use is n't to spicy but it has some zing to it .	1
She worked up a sample crust , applied toppings in the ideal amounts and order - taking in to consideration moisture content , cooking limitations we would have to translate to home ovens , etc .	1
Long story short , I guess it depends on who 's helping you , but I had a great experience with most of the staff , and they do have the best selection as far as board shorts , rash guards and memorabilia .	1
We will definitely be back and will recommend it to others .	1
Great selection and extremely helpful .	1
The waitstaff is very attentive .	1
Two thumbs up for a quick cheap meal .	1

All of them were delish and fresh .	1
I ordered the creamy potato tacos , they were the best tacos I have ever had !	1

The food was fantastic and we will definitely come back here in the future	1
There are some great fish and cool exhibits .	0
Will definitely be back again soon .	1
I 'd like to see more people in their 20 's who go to games regularly , but that obviously takes time !	1

Note : This is just a few blocks from City of Asylum 's painted houses and next to that is the Mattress Factory Museum , all doable within a few hours and well worth the trip .	1
Rest assured , when I move to Toronto , I will be frequenting this place often !	1

The employees are so friendly too !	1
She is awesome and I 'm so lucky to love my doctors office !	1

It was a generous size ( ordered the large ) ; everything was fresh and I loved the house dressing .	1

Large pies , large slices with the 19inch and they have a 25incher that would feed a large group ( the 19 each will easily satisfy 3-5 hearty eaters easily ) , good stuff .	1

Second time around was perfect .	1

In this instance though , the salad was the first menu item that jumped out at me , and so I felt it was a must .	1
Of course one of the good parts about AYCE is you can try to try many of their delicious wing flavors , but they do have a five wing minimum per flavor and will only allow you to order 10 wings up front .	1

One of my favorite buffets is located here at the M Resort ... called the Studio B Buffet ... mouthwatering good !	1
Everything was great .	1
I ordered hot and spicy vegetable pho with shrimp it is to die for .	1
Nurses , CNA 's , therapists ( Aaron was my primary PT ) , and in house doctors and social worker and administrator Jim were all fantastic .	1
These guys were great !	1
The pastry itself was light , flaky , and buttery , which was a plus for me .	1
I was looking forward to this as we usually eat here 2 times a month or more and it 's one of my favorites .	0
I came in with an issue with my glasses and Jerry took really good care of me !	1
He was very professional and informative throughout the process .	1
The happy hour food is the best and the prices are unbelievable .	1

Highly recommended for the escape room enthusiast .	1
I was on the hunt for tapas , and this little spot does delicious small plates .	1
I will be back that 's for sure that 's why I give it 5 stars * * * * *	1
After requesting that I be able to keep the a la carte menu to peruse during my meal , I delighted in the colourful photos and descriptions that were to be tough choices for less frugal future meals and could n't wait to be back .	1
Had a great time overall !	1
Would highly recommend hitting this place up for breakfast or brunch and then heading over to the market for some fresh produce , meats and cheeses .	1
I 'd highly recommend this great little neighborhood place .	1
The chicken is great , even without the special sauce !	1
I will definitely come back when I am in the area .	1
The fried catfish was excellent .	1
However , for the price it was a great deal .	1
Both were really tasty and fresh .	1
Our server , Erica , was friendly and attentive throughout .	1
We had a blast searching for the clues , solving the puzzles , and piecing together the story .	1
Hands down , they are the BEST .	1
I highly recommend this place .	1
I absolutely loved NY bride and groom !	1
They have a rotating tap list of really good beers !	1
4.5 stars .	1
Thank you ! ! !	1
Great selection of both foreign and domestic cheeses .	1
Although i do enjoy heavy , flavor enhanced broths that mask the natural taste of the meat , veggies , and other substances sometimes , for the most part , I think food taste best when you can actually TASTE it .	1
They are an Aveda salon ( which I love ) located right off Mill Ave in Tempe .	1
Customer service is A1 very attentative , all smiles , food brought to the table .	1
If you are a non-smoker , you will love this .	1
The spacious downstairs doubles as tasting room and live music venue .	1
Only reason I do n't give them 5 stars is because I 've only been there once , so I do n't know if their service is always this good , though I think it is .	1
We have one that 's on our side of town !	1
This time , I ordered a torta , but not just any torta , but a carne version !	1
I 've been to few high class restaurants , but It 's customer service was among the best imo .	0
There 's a reason the wait is so long ...... the food is frickin great ! ! !	1
) , calamari , steak tartare , and oysters as our first course .	1

Loved every aspect of the transaction , even the parts department ( we had a few accessories added ) !	1
Absolute magic .	1
I 've been coming here since they first opened and have n't been disappointed yet .	1
We love capping our night off after going out on 5th or the Epicentre with a comfy classy and somewhat expensive trip to the Ritz .	1
Great job guys , I hope you recognized for all that you do !	1
It 's a little on the pricy side as most places on the strip but well worth the extra $ .	1
We usually come here often not only because we love the food but the people who work here treat us so amazing , Scott , Ryan and of course our most favorite waitress in the world FABIENNE ! !	1
The staff is amazing and care alot about you and how you feel .	1
Kyle , her support wait staff , promptly filled our water glasses .	1
I will return and next time try the eggs Benedict , the lady at the table next to me had it and it looked amazing .	1
Excellente pâtisserie oú nous avons trouvé les meilleurs gâteaux de Montréal , à savoir des gâteaux de savoie présentés en hauteur dans des moules papiers ou en grosse part avec une fine couche de crème au milieu ! ! !	1
The masseuse was wonderful and did wonders on my back .	1
The salad bar was outstanding .	1
And excellent customer service too ! !	1
The chips are hot and fresh with yummy salsa .	1
On décide de partager un grilled cheese avec canard confit ainsi qu'une tartine inspiration du jour , remplie de bonnes choses .	1
You would be very fortunate to have her as your realtor !	1
She quoted me a quick turnaround time on short notice and gave great suggestions on the tailoring !	1
They also have a selection of freshly made salsas , though the fish tacos have a nice kick on their own .	1
Alfajores are simple cookie-type goodies made of corn starch , filled with Dulce de Leche ( caramel ) in the centre and dusted off with powder sugar .	1
The eggs scramble was delicious .	1
The Korean Gochujang sauce was the right balance of sweet smoky spicy goodness for the meat .	1

Awesome salon with great service !	1
Holy moly , reminded me of chicken fried steak , it was AH-MAZING !	1
The owner is friendly and checks up on you to make sure all is good .	1
Very glad my husband and I decided to try this place out cuz we have n't had a bad experience yet ! !	1
It looked amazing and she raved about it throughout dinner .	1
The 2for 1 drink special is the best deal ! ! !	1
It reminds me of the Nagycsarnok in Budapest : a huge indoor market with beautiful produce , butcher shops , bakeries , cheese shops .	1
What a great neighborhood find !	1
The decorations , design , service , and even the washroom is perfect .	1
I ordered the appetizer wings and a side salad as my meal and was completely satisfied .	1

Food is always consistently delicious .	1
Awesome buffet with a good selection of food .	1
My first time to Glazers and what a nice experience !	1
This was definitely our experience here tonight .	0
Top notch !	1
When we go , we sit in front of the window so my kids can watch the crepes being made , and one of the servers there hooks my girls up with unlimited amounts of whipped cream and shares his pictures of his cats with them .	1
Lightest touch of mayo , always get a claw , and a lightly toasted and buttered roll .	1
Parking is not always the greatest but once you get in you 're golden !	1
As for everything else , they have decent selection , the store is kinda dingy looking inside but they carry decent brands of blowdryers and straighteners , and you 'll get stuff for a little cheaper than you will elsewhere .	1
We would definitely return if we go back to Arizona again .	1
My technician makes it quick and painless .	1
We definitely recommend Palmer 's Lawn Care/Palmer 's Landscaping for your patio and landscape instillation needs !	1
So , 4 stars .	1
This was the BEST experience with a tattoo parlor that I have ever had !	1
He was helpful with some questions we had and was very caring with Raph .	1
It adds a perfect , yet delicate crunch .	1
I had a tiny tattoo of a wave done on my foot and I am absolutely in love !	1
One of the best pizza places I have ever had !	1
The burgers were good quality and the salad came with a special sauce , which made a good accompaniment for the fries - I recommend asking for a side if you get fries .	1
On the day I tried it , I got clam , white fish , tuna , salmon and other good stuff ; yum !	1
Natalie and her staff made sure all of my decorations ( as particular and as silly as I asked for ) were fulfilled exactly as I had envisioned and , actually , even better .	1
He was the best !	1
I went for the chorizo tacos and I was not disappointed ... You could probably put jalapeno bacon on anything and I 'd eat it , though ... lol Seriously , scrambled eggs , cheese , cilantro and chorizo ?	1
Also , due to it 's thickness , it had a great beef flavor that was complimented by the light toppings added .	1
I went with a small loaf of banana nut bread and the ham and Swiss sandwich to split with my son .	1
Easy gallery link to download and share all photos .	1
Located beside ( walkable ) from the Cinemark at Valley View which is so nice .	1
I had the Saurbrauten and the apel strudel , I highly recommend both .	1
Best part is that it seems like Chris ' main relationship is with all the clubs at the Palms which are my favorite .	1
Of course , they have all the amazing desserts out for you to see so you can not pass them up .	1
Park de la Fountain is a short walk away and is great for jogging and strolling and it has a nice little cafe for brunch or lunch with outdoor seating .	1
Bought some drinks 50 bucks for a bucket of 6 beers not too bad I guess .	0
It 's still as good as before !	1
Great food and great service !	1
A gem indeed .	1
I was very hesitant to come back to SMIL but now I am so happy I came to this location .	1
This was my first experience at a piano bar , and I definitely enjoyed myself !	1
Food is delicious and reasonably priced .	1
Wow those guys rock !	1
I love their happy hour menu and I 'm a huge fan of the traditional Italian food .	1
Definitely my favorite meal of my Vegas trip .	1
It was nice that they offered samples of the fish before you decide .	1
Overall the food was good and reasonably priced .	1
In the summer it will transform into an indoor/outdoor music extravaganza right on the river .	1
We got the balsamic and ranch which were both freshly made and fantastic , but the salad could really use some more to it .	1
This place is definitely worth a shot .	1
I highly recommend this restaurant if you want to try something new !	1
The food is always soooooo good !	1
In addition to the beer , ass juice and bartenders they also have live music a great juke box and pretty decent people .	1
My favourite poke is their salmon with either the sushi rice or zoodles and grapefruit sauce .	1
Each one had very flavorful broth and noodles .	1
I was somewhat reluctant to attempt this place since , truly , trust it or not , I 'm not very obsessed with southern style sustenance , which was what their menu basically offered.Service was extremely mindful : consistent keeping an eye on us , refilled our waters .	1
We order a mixed vegetable dish and veggies are crisp , fresh and delicious .	1
I would recommend it to anyone visiting the area : )	1

The facility is clean and everyone is very nice .	1
The staff is always inviting and gives me my drink with a smile ,	1
Really yummy !	1
I would recommend this place to anyone who likes to try a little bit of everything on the menu .	1
This place was great !	1
I love the gentle wax and Theresa who has done my brows a few times is amazing and so sweet !	1
What is great is the free Million Dollar picture and the free parking with validation .	1
The reason I say this is because number one , I 'm half black so my hair is a little more challenging to deal with , but she did n't seem intimidated at all .	1
Food , drink and service were all excellent !	1
He did exactly what he said he would do and was very knowledgeable .	1
This Postino is not as `` trendy '' as the others but definitely one of the best spots in Gilbert .	1
You will not be disappointed !	1
Know that they do have vegetarian/vegan options in addition to what 's usually on the menu ( yay ) .	1
Aside from the lucky locals that know about this cafe , I imagine that it is also a popular breakfast/lunch destination for the surrounding business folks , as it is located in a considerably large , fairly occupied plaza .	1
She let me try on a good amount of dresses , personally helping me into and out of each one !	1
The Miso broth has a special place in my heart .	1
She was thorough and considerate and I never felt rushed .	1
Very nice , boutique hotel at the end of the Las Vegas strip .	1
Great place that knows their stuff .	1
Great job and friendly service ! !	1
He has always , even before we were regulars , been prompt , efficient , and very friendly .	1
I 'm a big fan of having the right proportion of food and they get it right here ..... there 's enough of each ingredient to be able to taste each flavor without overwhelming the taste buds with a single item .	1
I came in the morning and it was pretty busy , but the workers are all very fast so do n't expect to wait that long !	1
Had the turkey burger , which was very tasty .	1
The mall is very clean , and the food court had a full time cleaner , so the tables were spotless .	1
Great customer service !	1
Sneaky Dees is one of those places with fantastic food and fantastic atmosphere !	1
This is delicious .	1
We would definitely come here again for the pizza , not the glowing personality of their staff .	1
My favorite is the spicy ahi .	1
I 'm a huge fan of anything pineapple coconut so their drinks were really satisfying for me .	1
Very well maintained short 9 hole course .	1
The suite rooms are very spacious and clean .	1
Walking back to the hotel room , people were asking us where we got the slices and telling them it 's at `` secret pizza '' was the best !	1
The half price bottles of wine on Thursday is a nice touch too !	1
And the desserts were amazing .	1
My son plays basketball in the JCC league and also come here sometimes for his practice .	1
Great beer , great atmosphere .	1
The people that work here and the owner are always very pleasant to deal with .	1
He made me feel comfortable and made me laugh a lot .	1
My mom 's Chile Verde burrito was delicioso too .	1
I liked that the food is freshly prepared and you do n't have to wait forever when you 're hungry .	1
Brent was patient and took the random hair ideas I was trying to express and really knew how to interpret what I wanted and turn it into something even better with his own expertise .	1
If I could give a 4.5 stars , I would .	1
Great spot to chill and grab some beers .	1
The gai lan was perfect and helped make our livers feel better after a weekend of wedding festivities .	1
The fries and onion strings were so good .	1
Also the owners are super nice .	1
They know their stuff !	1
Would come back and eat here again !	1
I got the Hells Kitchen burger and it was outstanding !	1
The atmosphere is very nice as well .	1
The only downside is I do n't live close enough .	1
The potatoes are unreal !	1
As authentic as you can get ! ! !	1
Otherwise , totally recommend this place to try at least once .	1
Our taxes have been a MESS for years ... A friend told me about them and it was the best advice ever !	1
Recommend spicy tuna kimbap and the mushroom medley was great with my beef dish .	1
Will be back .	1
You will be pleased .	1
Will be back ! !	1
Downtown Phoenix has so many places that serve delicious foods .	1
The salmon love roll was beautifully presented , and tasted amazing .	1
We each had a thoroughly enjoyable cocktail from the menu and shared several small plates .	1
They were able to deliver a dental kit in under 30 minutes which included a toothbrush and toothpaste .	1
She did a great job on my face , I had deep cleaning and a session of micro needling , she is a professional and I will see her soon again ... thank you so much Bertha !	1
Overall , my salon experience is always relaxing and enjoyable - and Patrick and Corey at the front desk are absolutely delightful .	1
Had lunch here today and loved it .	1
What a great first visit !	1
Best Thai food place I 've had ! ! !	1
Great Service !	1
It also does n't hurt that the staff is super nice and friendly .	1
The food is great !	1
Definitely favorite happy hour spot !	1
He was also cool to let me try any of the flavors that I wanted .	1
The Press Lounge is quickly found as you enter pass a modern art structure and we sauntered off to the outdoor cozy patio where we found round glass fire pits , twinkling lights on trees and the soft sound of a waterfall in the background .	1
They finished in the time told to us which was really appreciated .	1
The salon itself is really cute and comfortable , spacious yet cozy , welcoming and not uptight or pretentious .	1
The girl serving us ( I wish I could remember her name ) was so so sweet and very helpful when we wanted suggestions on wine to try and different dishes .	1
The food came out quickly and they easily modified menu items to our liking without complaint .	1
I enjoyed my experience here and savored the special touches .	1
Really awesome Mexican restaurant close to my work .	1
this is always a great place to eat either late night or when pressed for time .	1
Large portions at reasonable prices , a variety of sweet and savory breakfasts , and a lunch menu make this the perfect place for a quick bite .	1
Also , could use a delicious baguette to soak up the D1 Goodness in the shrimp boil .	1
Dr. Bullard worked his heart out to help keep my beloved service dog alive and comfortable during the end stages of terminal disease .	1
Seriously , the customer service is amazing .	1
The reason this is so neat is because some people actually dress up .	1
I 've only come here for lunch and always to go , but each time I get two slices of plain Sicilian and its by far the best Sicilian pizza I 've had in NC .	1
This is the place to be in Las Vegas ! ! !	1
The yelp review mentioned the Thai tea so we ordered it ( a little pricey at $ 4 ) and it was the best we 've had .	1
This place is fantastic !	1
Staying in venetian was the best ever experience ! ! !	1
The interior is super nice !	0
Everything from the service , the food and the atmosphere was really enjoyable .	1
Their vegan options were so good .	1
They also offer gelato .	1
Atmosphere was nice and service was excellent .	1
Amazing !	1
This place is amazing the food & drinks are really good , the entertainment is awesome fun place dj , band & karaoke very nice environment	1
It is a very small store with one bench to sit on - but it was a beautiful summer night so I was more than happy to stroll around the area after getting the Ice Cream .	1
The sushi chefs always talk to us and staff always attentive .	1
They are very knowledgeable with the products and were able to fix both with little effort .	1
Probably my favorite Cirque du Soleil show .	1
Lately , I am into healthier stuff and so when he suggested The Brown Bag , I immediately pulled it up on Yelp to be sure there was more than just carb heavy sandwiches .	1
I highly recommend this place !	1
NEW additions this year - ALOT of cashiers & the food area is awesome - way to go Gilcrease !	1
They are very different from each other , although both worth seeing .	1
We let our server choose our menu and we were n't disappointed .	1
You have to know that their mac and cheese is creamy and rich and the absolute BEST I have had in a restaurant .	1
It is family owned and operated and it 's obvious that they take great pride in the the food and customer service .	1
This place is also my favorite for their fries and buffalo chicken sandwich .	1
I cant wait to go back and try the sliders - we spied some from afar and they look spectacular !	1
Their ham serving seems skimpy for $ 3.50 , but is also consistently tasty and has the perfect amount of `` crisp '' from the griddle .	1
Whether it 's jewelry , handbags or other accessories , I have been very satisfied .	1
This is a great place to go if you want options .	1
We had balcony seating with a good view of the stage `` from on high '' but the acoustics were surprisingly good for the cheapest seats .	1
The only weird thing I found was that they serve the cooked and raw apples with the rinds on .	1
They make it a great experience	1
This one is by far my favorite !	1
Wonderful potato pancakes with salmon , mushroom strew , short rib stroganoff .	1
Totally recommend .	1
The waiters are awesome , so friendly and very informative if you have questions .	1
I loved the soup and appetizers !	1
The manager Chad & Steve always make us feel welcomed and appreciated .	1
The Pappy Van Winkle 15 yr old Rye was outstanding .	1
In terms of the bakery counter ... you really cant go wrong .	1
Jennifer Fields always goes above and beyond .	1
The place is very clean !	1
I 'd love to return to try their breakfast or lunch menu .	1
This place is very well done for a shop in strip mall .	1
The facility itself was very well-kept had a lot of interesting items on display !	1
The price is also quite nice because for being such a busy place they could probably charge a bit more ( like lots of other ramen places ) and still keep he crowds coming in .	1
The quality of service was unmatched at other places I had looked for a luxury watch .	1
Highly recommend it !	1
We WILL be back when back in town .	1
She listened to all my problems and helped the dentist understand .	1
The decor is fun and makes it a comfortable place to relax and they have board games too .	1
BYOB .	1

Quality of the meat is good and delicious broth .	1
They stuff these tacos with your filling of choice , we had the steak , chipotle chicken , and the pork what a great deal .	1
Wowza people !	1

The place is spotless .	0
Really nice people making really wonderful tacos !	1
Highly recommend this Med Spa ! !	1
Plus we just got done eating at Shake Shack so we were full .... Javier 's is quite possibly the best specialty dining Mexican food on the strip ... specialty meaning in between fine dining and them casual restaurants like Chevy 's and Border Grill .	1
Calvin , my fiancé , had a great birthday dinner thanks to her !	1
Fabulous experience !	1
You just ca n't go wrong with Kimberly as your agent !	1
Will be returning weekly !	1
Considering the location is so close to the action , I loved it there , every minute of it .	1
They picked the chairs up on a Friday morning , and we got them back first thing Monday morning , and they looked perfect .	1
First week for this new Zach Bruell restaurant and it 's already worth a visit .	1
Thanks Joe !	1
We were a group of 5 ( 4 adults and a kiddo ) and we ordered : - 2 laksas - char keuy teow - green curry - roti The food was amazing .	1
I can not say enough about the wonderful experience we had working with Kyle and the crew of Capital Mark .	1
I do n't know how they got it so perfect .	1
Would definitely recommend .	1
My fave is the hummus with chicken !	1
The rooms are beautifully decorated .	1
The downside to the high ceilings is that noise level is n't perfect - music , when noticeable , was a nice mix that I enjoyed but when the space was crowded , it barely registered .	1
The haircut is terrific , and he now looks even more handsome !	1
It was refreshing and did its job in keeping me awake .	1
Overall a great experience .	1
After promptly arriving , Jeff quickly and efficiently unclogged my bathroom sink ... and shared good advise on how to avoid future clogs .	1
The Sriracha Remoulade was a tasty counterpoint .	1
I do love that they offer the early bird special tickets at $ 6.75 , which makes going to the movies a tad more affordable .	1
I was super impressed with the service received at crazy mocha .	1
Had their iced tea which is a flavored unsweetened tea which was really good .	1
Baklava is extra tho .	1
I LOVE the falafel salad with the garlic parsley dressing YUMMMM	1
I 'll definitely be a return customer especially since I live 2 minutes away , haha .	1
$ 4.99 for a cup of steaming hot chicken tortilla soup , some of their special Southpark Chicken Salad .... and a nice bottle of vino ( always on sale ) and I am one happy camper !	1
Their homemade oatmeal cookies are too die for ! ! !	1
The sauce served with the empanada had a nice kick and nice flavor .	1
I 'll definitely bring back my iPad and have the screen replaced here ..	1
I will be back EVERY.SINGLE.TIME I come to Vegas !	1
Kim , the sushi chef , is a great guy and made us some delicious dishes , one after the other .	1
Nice , unique atmosphere .	1
Clearly she 's passionate about her pierogies and her food in general.Probably best for takeaway since there 's little seating available inside or outside .	1
Ebi - Prawn- lime zest with shrimp not my favorite pairing of flavours .	1
Super friendly !	1
Best experience at this location with Justin and Jaime .	1
Hands down , fried ice cream was amazing .	1
Fluery is an awesome goalie ! !	1
Derek made it his mission to come back to our room with our bags .	0
They let you sample anything flavour you want , so you can even try out the durian for lols if you know you are n't ready for that level of commitment .	1
The coffee was also really good .	1
Service was very quick here in the beginning as we sat down .	1
Center Cut Steakhouse looks nice from the outside , and we noticed that they serve a Foie Gras appetizer and have a BOGO happy hour that includes a Blueberry Mojito , so on May 22 , 2014 we decided to give them a try .	0
It was so easy !	1
All the staff and doctors were amazing .	1
The scrambles ( sundried tomato and bacon is my favorite ) are always cooked slightly runny , which I prefer .	1
Not your typical pub grub .	1
This is a great family friendly place to stay .	1
Even though it 's a bit farther for me to drive out to , the peace of mind and quality work more than makes up for it !	1
Your gate will be hand made here in Phoenix and done exactly as you want it to be .	1
Loved the bahn mi too !	1
Matt also was available for follow up emails that once again were prompt and thoughtfull .	1
Delicious drinks and amazingly friendly staff !	1

When it came time to pick up my Jeep , Chris took the time to walk me into the shop and show me exactly what was done and answer any of my questions very thoroughly .	1
Concessions - good thing I was the DD , holy crap expensive .... I 'm not paying $ 8 for a single small adult beverage Seating - I had a pavilion seat , center stage just behind the box seats , great view .	0
5/5 .	1
Ca n't wait to go back and try more !	1
For the regular carnivores the spread is fantastic .	1
Great ... now I 'm drooling ...	1
As you can see from the photos , I requested an over medium egg on my burger and it was absolutely flawless .	1
I am in love with my nails every time I come here !	1
At 4 AM , the best stuff is rolling out of the fryers , the cherry glaze melting , the the doughnut holes crispy and chewy and almost hot , the box will actually steam some in the winter .	1
They offer most everything and the staff is wonderful .	1
Has House A Go Go makes sin taste so good !	1
Balance of the sweet and salty was so unique and delish !	1
This is the best cheesecake I 've ever had so far , and the staff is amazing , also you could try a sample if you like , and you could get other stuff there as well like cookies .	1

I loved the atsmophere- cool and trendy but can also be intimate and romantic .	1
Take your money and go to a lounge ( Andres at the Venetian , for example ) , and buy 3-4 high end pours of your favorite stuff .	0
We also had the thanksgiving dinner there that included a little dessert .	1
We are new to the concept of bike tours and are addicted to them henceforth , something we like to blame the great folks at Fitz & Follwell for .	1
Great coffee !	1
Best southwest salad too .	1
With some of the best service I have ever had , the Jaleo team kept the food coming !	1
We 've already decided that we 'll be back for breakfast , lunch , and dinner !	1

Owner Joey is awesome and very friendly .	1
I love that they take time afterwards to take photos with the audience .	1
THEY WERE GREAT ! ! !	1

I visited them at a corporate function so it was nostalgic trying some old favorites and some new selections as well .	1

- Tempura - Nice and Crispy !	1
The food is typical of a bar type place but always fresh , hot and crispy .	1
The burgers are fresh , flavorful and made to order in an open kitchen ..	1
But the P900 is freaking good .	1
Everyone from the hostess to the server and chef were lovely !	1

It was an overall nice dinner experience with good wine , conversation , and of course food !	1
Great place , inexpensive and did a solid great job ! !	1
The food did take a while to come out but that is because everything is prepared fresh .	1
I come here often and the staff is consistent and knows me .	1
The hummus and pita bread was great , schwarma was very tasty , and a huge selection of alcoholic beverages .	1
A bit on the quite side because of its newness , which makes it the perfect place at any time of day for a great cup of coffee and a good book .	1
My husband ordered the Hash & eggs - reasonably priced , quick service and a ton of food to start your long days off right !	1
And also they have deals on juices !	1
Plus , the pool and hot tub were fantastic !	1
Even though the dinner was amazing , our waiter was exceptional , and our mouths melted over the desserts , the true cherry on top was the breathtaking watershow that we had front row seats to every 15 minutes .	1
My lamb shank was tender and tasty .	1
The food was good but pretty typical so nothing to rave about but I def enjoyed the ambiance and drinks .	1
I do wish they replaced that current selection of Dogfish Head with a 60/90/120 minute IPA , that would be amazing but ca n't really complain !	1
One of the best birthdays I ever had !	1
There is a large bar area and comfortable seating throughout the restaurant .	1
5 stars is not enough to rate the Hash House .	1
As the annoying Rachel Ray would say `` YUMM-O '' This is by far the best pizza I have had in Vegas ... While Metro Pizza and Joe 's are close , I am officially addicted .	1
Today was unique , I decided to dip my toes into this Caribbean spot since I 've read the reviews .	1
They also host the cutest birthday parties , I happened to stop in during a princess party that was super cute !	1

=P Overall , I had a lot of fun ! !	1
Ray and Bill and the others at MB-Henderson were very helpful and responsive .	1
If you deem those to be unnecessary extras , then you should visit High Park Nails where $ 30 plus tax gets you a regular mani/pedi and a bubble tea which you ca n't substitute for a leg scrub , got ta pay extra : P	1
The prints were very high quality and the customization with our names on it was outstanding .	1
Food quality is perfect too .	1
Inside the seating is comfortable and the ambiance appropriate .	1
This place is simply amazing .	1
You can also grab a few bottles of water and apples while you are visiting .	1
Every bite was perfect , and it was n't giant with a ton of lettuce left over , I ate every bite and every bite had delicious salmon in it .	1
But I am a fan this place after eating there a couple of nights ago I knew i was going to come back !	1
So great without being too super sweet ... And the crust was buttery and delicious .	1
Two kinds of salsa and beans were served to us with homemade chips yum !	1
Her food gives you that warm feeling inside like it was cooked especially for you & makes you want to give the Chef a hug for such great food .	1

The staff was great and there was a great jazz band playing .	1
It was heavenly .	1

Le XL américain c'est du XXL chez nous et il vaut mieux essayer tout avant d'acheter ( on peut , le personnel est super aimable ) .	1

Will definately visit again when i 'm back in Henderson .	1
The Trini lady at Coconut Grove made me a wonderful stewfish roti , and carefully packed it up for my trip to the airport .	1
Nice sweet and savory with cinnamon and Sage .	1
They stopped lunch delivery on weekends , which sucks , but beside that and the occasional missing egg roll , this place is great , and my workplace orders here about once a week .	1

Awesome !	1

I just detest lines , especially lines filled with stroller totin ' moms that want to sample everything themselves as well as feed it to their kids .	1

Almost all the dishes are $ 2 for the same portion size and quality as other dim sum places - such a good deal ! ! !	1
Finally made a stop today and my overall experience was awesome !	1
- Toilettes pas trop propres ( plus très vieilles que malpropres a vrai dire ) -Arriver tôt ( avant 10h ) -Le catalogue manque de hits récents !	1

I always get the Alaskan chowder , and even though it is $ 20 per bowl , it is worth every dollar !	1
He also made suggestions on where to place my nose ring , which I was thankful for because he probably stares at peoples ' faces all day and knows what looks good/does n't look good .	1
I was very impressed with the service as well .	1
They communicated with us on a regular basis , and were able to recover a lot of the carpet since they acted quickly .	1
I WILL BE BACK .	1

We ate at the restaurant ( that looks like a 50 's diner ) and really enjoyed ourselves !	1

If you are in Vegas this is a must do place !	1
Foods are jammed so close together they inevitably get mixed , including the sauces and meats which could be a big issue for people with dietary restrictions ( especially considering that they seem to try to make it a very accommodating experience to such people otherwise )	0
