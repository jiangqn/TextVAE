My two favourite things combined into one place .	1
They did n't come back to ask us if we wanted another drink ( we did ) and they did n't offer water , we had to ask at the end when they brought our check .	0
Employees are rude making remarks behind customers in which I find unacceptable .	0
While I love having all the food and not having to wait , there is also a time when the food comes to quick that you ca n't enjoy it and you have to help them find room on the table .	0

At the initial visit , sure truly listened , and even supported my thoughts and wishes on how I would hope to proceed .	1
We ended up wasting 40 minutes at this place and feeling starving and frustrated after .	0
I will also discourage friends who are interested in choosing Basil as they clearly have no empathy towards their regular customers and are unwilling to accept fault and make things right .	0
The smoke comes out and smells wonderful .	1
The seafood bisque was ok , but again not worth the price since they serve it in a bowl 1/4 utilized .	0

He is professional , very knowledgeable , and extremely pleasant to be around .	1
When I was told the price I immediately called the office and spoke to Maria who was rude and had the worse customer service that I have ever experienced .	0
Check in is always pleasant and easy .	1
I have had some spotty experiences with PGATS in the past ( nothing bad , mind you , but nothing that necessarily made me want to come back ) , so this gentleman was a refreshing change .	1
The crowd was a blast and everyone had fun seeing each other 's interpretations of the original picture .	1
They were so patient and easy to work with through the whole process , even when there were changes .	1
So I asked Marlene , the receptionist and she merely asked Chris , `` What number do you want me to give her ? ''	0
When I asked her about 35 $ as advertised she pretended like she did n't understand me all together and demanded $ 70 .	0
I 'm very happy with my window tint experience .	1

It was pretty small portions though and pricey compared to other chinese restaurants , but the quality was really good .	1

That was useless and not helpful at all .	1

I should of known what to expect when I arrived at my appointment , due to another woman complaining about how long she had been waiting for her oil change and in order to calm her down they gave her a 10 % discount .	0
The food here is your typical national chain nothing special food although the cookie dessert is to die for .	1

The steak was very tender and very flavourful and cooked to a perfect medium rare .	1
At $ 16 , the dish is a little more than I 'd generally spend for lunch , but well worth every penny .	1

I got coffin shape and it was done perfectly !	1

At our rehearsal , she was patient with every family members questions and did n't seem frazzled at having to repeat instructions 2 to 3 ( and sometimes 4 ) times .	1

NO , now I want my crappy $ 12.40 check since you are incompetent .	0

I recommend McGhie 's for your bike needs .	1
Although I will say the staff are friendly , the restaurant itself is disgusting .	0
She only attended to one set of people but not us plus the bar seems to be falling apart this place should not be in Scottsdale as I expect better service and better class .	0
Overall , I highly recommend this location -- you will not be disappointed if you make your next eye appointment at this eyecarecenter location .	1
Great music .	0
On a Sunday afternoon of a long weekend , the service was slow , potentially the slowest service I 've ever had in my entire life 's existence .	0

I appreciate the honesty in doing that refund but when I brought up my radio issue I was essentially told too bad and that they did n't touch it so it must have been broken when I brought it in which was not the case at all .	0

Then a manager comes out and asks what happened we re-explained everything and she said the same thing .	0
I had the rising sun burger and it 's one of the best burgers I 've ever had !	1
I was amazingly surprised that these wings packed a spicy punch , not enough to turn my stomach inside out , but enough that it blended well with the flavor that i had selected .	1

Brought tickets to see a dj for 10 of my friends and I and could n't get in because the girls in the front was being rude and racist so they did n't let us in .	0
Service was prompt despite the restaurant being crowded on a holiday evening .	1
I recommend to save room for dessert ( preferably the banana flambé ) because not only is it delicious but it 's also a great show to top off your meal .	1
Now , even if you are busy , anyone with half an ounce of experience with food service etiquette should know to at least greet the customer , and if necessary , let them know you will be right with them .	0
We initially went for some ribs and 20 minutes later the waitress comes back and says more bad news we are out of ribs ! ! !	0

We got boxes because we were so stuffed .	1
I would not use this business ever again or recommend to friends .	0
The worse was the fact that I ordered the grilled octopus and specifically asked our server about the dish before ordering .	0
I walk in and am greeted with a spacious dining area , flat screens all around , very few customers , a friendly whistling waitress and a boss chef getting down in the kitchen .	1
The reason why was because the chicken and fries had zero seasoning .	1
Over priced mediocre food .	0
The service was very fast , restaurant kept very clean , and the nice atmosphere with several neat Greek photos on the walls make this place a great place to stop for a quick bite !	1
I will try my best to not go back .	0

Since I have to come to Phoenix on a regular basis , I am very excited to have found this gem and will be returning often ! ! ! ! !	1

A little bit pricy but it is totally worth !	1
They are all riders and had great insights and suggestions .	1

I was told that he was going to call me but I waited several days , which just added to my frustration .	0
It 's truly a beauty and I got it at what I consider a deal .	1
No answer at customer service today .	0

Service was weak at best , seemed rushed to get us out , clearing table while we were still eating .	0

I am so glad that a Yelp search led me to Dr. Swenson and his staff .	1

Although I would n't go far to say it 's a steal , I found it to be a reasonable value considering the nicer location and comfort of the room .	1
If they treated someone who was just trying to verify an employee 's work status then GOD only knows how they would treat a possible client or tenant .	0

First time here , but fun place to chill and grab some drinks !	1
This place totally sucks .	0
We have had them short us change and refuse to fix it , throw food at us , ignore us , and walk away while talking .	0
The staff are ultra friendly and helpful , ready to accommodate whatever you need , while whipping up some very tasty treats for everyone .	1
The food was not the greatest I 've ever had but the presentation , the service and sheer amount of food made this place a winner !	1

I 'll never bring my car here for anything I 'd rather drive across town for services this place is a joke .	0
Their BBQ sauce is perfect tangy/sweet and does n't seem fake or filled with preservatives or fillers or sweeteners .	1
We were served , fed and satisfied within an hour and we left very happy .	1

The service however was very poor .	0
This comes with the sides already paired , Chateau Potatoes and Thin Green Beans .	1

They 've got a great selection of useful essentials , as well as stylish , fun gifts .	1
The puzzles are challenging enough to keep you entertained without being frustrating .	1

Terrible terrible service .	0
Pretty sure they just gave me food poisoning .	0

This place is run by an extremely dishonest and untrustworthy person .	0
Sometimes the line at the drive thru and walk up window can be long , but they 're pretty quick and it 's always worth the wait !	1
I have never felt more disrespected and embarrassed .	0
We will not be returning .	0
My favorite options for the soda are Strawberry/Vanilla , Cake Batter , and Orange/Vanilla The Snow ( Snow cones for those of you out of the loop ) is also super duper good as well .	1
It 's not a first class dinning establishment but this place is definitely quirky and old !	1
We asked for a full refund because this is not a case of a customer wanting to just `` cancel an order , '' this is a case of an order that was just `` not fulfilled as quoted . ''	0
Desert was also excellent .	1
They continued to allow the dog in the store and ignored us .	0
This place is a unique vegan restaurant that you must absolutely give a try !	1
The shrimp was way overcooked and chicken tasted funny .	1
He was very kind and super attentive .	0

I 'm nine months pregnant , and I wanted a delicious cheeseburger .	0
I just ate at the Tropicana location and the pastrami sandwich was amazing .	1
When the part finally came in I asked if the fridge had to be emptied because the part that wast to be replaced was under the fridge and the guy on the phone said `` NO '' , which made no sense to me .	0
They were so delicious .	1
Amazing !	1
Well we paid the bill and no manager ever came over .... oh they walked around us plenty but never stopped .	0
My husband and I took our children along with my in-laws , who highly recommended the place .	0
They are so mouth watering , I ca n't wait to go back to vegas to eat here again !	1
This place is just as great as the regular My Big Fat Greek NON Express but cheaper .	1
The best guess is because so many customers continue to dispute wrongful charges and they have or will shut him down soon .	0
And of course when it came out they were in these ridiculous tiny containers that maybe held a tablespoon , I wanted to scream ! ! ! !	0
During this time we 've been able to taste everything on their menu and we honestly love it all .	1
So glad I ate here .	1
I also liked that they had weekly Sake discounts .	1
horrible .	0
I watched the owners wife tell a customer not to come back if he did n't like cold somosas ... turns out neither do I , so I also left !	0
Food portions were awful !	0
Order two of these , and this is one of the best quick lunches you 'll have in Toronto !	1
This can also be shared because of the portion size .	1
Surprisingly great desert and a fantastic vibe round out this Resturant .	1
From Coffee to fresh brewed Iced Tea and the best Cappuccino Ive had , Press is fantastic .	1
I would like my bread as is '' She then asks me , `` do you want the meatballs cold too ? ''	0
Not to mention everyone in the salon is super nice , I felt like I had been going there for ages .	1
Service at this restaurant is terrible .	0
The big box stores are never staffed properly and you 're left wandering the aisles trying to find anything .	1
Corn bread was bland .	0
Nibbler 's Catering was an hour late picking up their dishes/pans with no contact regarding their delay .	0
Overall , one of the worst restaurant experiences for me .	0
Both were bland , room temperature , and just way overpriced for what you get .	0
All this paired with a traditional Hawaiian cocktail like a Dark & Stormy or Mai Tai , and you will swear you can hear the waves crashing on a nearby shore ...	1
They were incredibly nice .	1
Pro tip- the pineapple soft serve tastes just like Dole Whip from Disney World !	1
Will never stay there again .	0
Lap of Love : From the phone call to Dr. Jessica coming To put my Shylow down , I ca n't say enough on how compassionate they were .	1
Tried 3 attempts to call the police incharge for the case but no respond .	0

Worst pedicure expereince ever !	0
Save your money .	0
It may not have the most diverse menu , but EVERYTHING is delicious and worth the money you pay .	1
I have given this location several attempts ( 10 or more ) to gain me a customer , but sadly they do not meet my expectations .	0
Todd kept us updated and in the end the final cost came in at budget .	1
If I have to watch what is going on , to make sure it happens , and ca n't trust they do what I brought my car in for , with no communication if they do n't , that is just plain not good .	0
Unacceptable .	0
After class you can enjoy a pot of tea with friends in their tea room or patio which is a great way to build community within the studio .	1
The food was okay , the pasta was still hard and forgot a few of our items and still charged us .	0
At about 4:30PM , I emailed Ontrac and asked that the package be dropped at the door if I 'm not there since I needed to run some errands .	0
To charge 25 $ a head and to almost full seats , she grossly underpaid and demanded too much of her performers .	0
I definitely recommend this place .	1
The closet located just outside of the bathroom is a little small , it can hang maybe about 6-8 items perfectly .	0
my first year with them was good , after I transferred the service to a new house they increased the price by almost 20 dollars without letting me know until they sent me the contract by email .	0
If you are in the homestead area and need a pick me up then I would definitely recommend .	1
I will be back again and soon !	1
He took his time to explain the different techniques that he offers along with the benefits .	1
There 's also a bar accessible so you can add some flavour to your meal .	1

Kudos to Sandra Huntsman ( Lady of the Lake ) for her beautiful voice .	1
He is the best we 've ever been to .	1
Go and you will not regret .	1
The attendant and the manager were not rude to me when we were discussing this but I 'm still very unhappy with this situation .	0
Called and talked to the manager Kenny and asked if we could have it delivered since they messed up twice .	0
Their fries are also very good , perfectly seasoned , and you get a ton with just one side order .	1
We will be back .	1
We were not informed properly about the wait time ( there 's a big difference between 20 and 80 minutes ) and we had to ask for even the smallest amenities like silverware and plates .	0
When I called to get it straighten out I was told it would take 3 DAYS for it to hit my account .	0
I will be back for lunch , and probably also for a casual dinner .	1
Very disappointed , especially for the asinine prices .	0
The workers were pleasant to work with , however the owner was disappointing and I can not recommend them at all .	0

APPETIZERS : Biggest disappointment ever .	1
But the bun looked yummy and i had pho tai for lunch , so here i am .	1
This place really is a secret hot spot .	1

I 've been attending pole classes here for two years .	1
Probably the WORST Club ive ever been to !	0

Awesome service too !	1
Great customer service , very personable and quick !	1
Finally at the register , we reiterated what we had ordered so she could collect the missing items and we were still given the wrong things .	0
Service is amazing and food is good .	1
Not only did the screw up my reservation changed rules and did n't inform me .	0
The place is a little small though and their appetizer choice is quite limited .	1
We will definitely return to this location .	1

The very next day I got a charge for $ 65 WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION !	0

The way I was treated by the front desk was enough reason to never step foot within a mile radias of this place .	0
Dim Sum here is terrible .	0
She answered with an `` I do n't know , '' more than once with no offer to try to answer questions , had no idea items were unavailable until after we had ordered them , and was incredibly unprofessional .	0
We loved the Persian rice it was so delicious !	1

She gives the `` go ahead '' and you 'll get a scalp and shoulder massage to relax , followed by a shampoo , conditioner , gel cleanser , warm face towel facial treatment , and a moisturizing hand massage .	1
Definitely would drive a few hours from AZ for some more !	1
Their breakfast is amazing and prices are also reasonable ... Family of eight ; including my parents , my son and siblings w/their significant others our bill total about $ 80 .	1
After mentioning this horrible service to them they decided to send a cheap bottle of wine and a $ 75 credit and that does n't even cover one night of the over priced upgrade .	0
A true gem of a place !	1
Food was not great either , way too salty .	0
I am letting the public know in this forum too to avoid Towbin Dodge ! ! !	0
I will NOT be coming back !	0

Our food took over 50 minutes to come out , it came out as soon as we voiced our concern .	0
Just the hearty mixture between the turkey burger , sun dried tomato , and feta cheese .	1
If you like good solid coffee as well as a place that actually roast their own beans , I highly recommend Six Shooter Coffee- definitely run over to Waterloo and try out this place- it 's so worth it .	1
We all came to the conclusion the pizza was among the best we 've ever had .	1
The principal is rude and unfair to students and treats them like they are scum .	0
The room upgrade was nice , but not enough for all of the horrible service throughout the resort .	0
Another mistake they made where my food just came out late but we all ordered the same thing .. Like my friend got the same order and my quesadilla just did n't wan na come .	0
Someone behind the bar did finally acknowledge us and told us to sit wherever we wanted .	0
On another note , looking into the appitizers , the lamb skewers were pretty good though mediocre in comparison to the bbq squid skewers which were cooked and seasoned to perfection !	0
One of my favorite lunch spots in Charlotte .	1
20 minutes later , nothing .	0
You can get it skinny which is quite helpful so my after baby body can shrink instead of grow .	1
I flagged down the only attendant and advised her of the system struggles to which she responded `` Oh ...	0
Friendly staff and tried the Bobbie which is their best seller .	1
I get that you 're a `` Snack Bar '' but avoid this place if you plan on getting full because for the price you are paying here , you will need to bring $ 200 - $ 500 in order to get full .	0
Everyone at Green Valley Smiles was extremely professional and friendly .	1
We had to throw it out because it was not edible at all .	0

Pepe 's is a cozy , family ran place that serves some awesome food !	1
My family & I will be back without a doubt .	1
The power went out when I had 20 minutes of jumping left and immediately the staff told us that we will either get reimbursed or get a voucher that will give us another half hour another time .	1
This is bad business .	0
I go here at least once a week when I am downtown and have never had a bad meal .	1
Communication was poor .	0
Better Business Bureau gave them an `` F '' .	0
When you 're recharged go try and spread the good vibes by helping another !	1
I 'd definitely come back .	1
The store was dead with about 10 people in it so the lack of customer service was actually shocking .	0
I paid $ 150 for VIP bottle service and he still had the nerve to harass me and eventually kick me out forcefully by grabbing my arm even though I repeatedly asked him to please let go of my arm that he was hurting me .	0
I 'm surprised this business has no respect for its customers .	0
Horeb : )	1
This place was just extremely underwhelming .	0
I have the emails from the last store they closed which I would have been happy to provide , but I 'm no longer interested in doing business with a company who does n't care about their clients , the people who keep their business running .	0
I have been coming here for years and am so happy with her work .	1
And you can bring your dog !	1
This Sakana Grill at the crowfoot location has definitely improved since the last time my friends and I went here .	1
This is a great pharmacy to take care of your special medication needs .	1
We were greeted by Rebecca and she is the best server I 've ever had in fine dining .	1
Disgusting !	0
The Pharmacy at this Shopper 's Drug Mart is one of the worst I 've ever been to .	0
But the item can be pre ordered ... okay , now I am told need to pay up front to pre order ..... REALLY ? ? ? ? ?	0
I explained to them on the phone last week that I would like them to fix the bad work they did or I would be requesting a refund .	0
After expressing that it was just replaced in February , I was told that the new radiator was no longer under warranty because I somehow drove THIRTY THOUSAND MILES between February and May , which voided the parts and labor warranty of 6,000 miles or 6 months .	0
That 's the only reason they get 1 star .	0
2 ) They never bother to honor double cheese or extra cheese orders .	0
I would not recommend this place at all .	0

Overall entry ambiance is pretty neat - you walk down a narrow brick corridor , which opens up to the actual room at the end .	1
Come check it out !	1

This place looks so outdated chopsticks were sticky .	0
Great staff , the owner is really funny and loves his work .	1
Dad paid $ 18 for slimy salmon ... farm raised which mind you is only $ 5/lb .	0
My highlights never had that horrible line when they were growing out , they never felt fried and they always looked completely natural ( other than the hot pink stripe which was completely on purpose ) .	1
So , I had high hopes for this place .	0
Both soup and salad came very quickly and my server checked on me a few times , but was not overbearing .	1
The latter is what makes it feel like you 're sitting down for a relaxing meal that you know will be delicious from start to finish with ingredients , pairings , and combinations that are n't always expected .	1
Sure , the server took my meal off the bill , but the fact that I was treated so poorly made an impression that no `` credit '' could make up for .	0
All very very good .	1
Great food and great people !	1
Between the seemingly ever-expanding floor space , energetic and friendly staff , and excellent organization , Drawn To Comics has been my comic store for years and will continue to be for many more .	1
The Vietnamese Herb sauce is also pretty good but I think the Korean Chili works really well with the chicken being fried .	1
Super yummy	1
It 's an awesome place with great ambiance .	1
Outstanding all the way around !	1
We plan on going on a Wednesday or Friday because they have entertainment that includes a rat pack style of music , dialogue and comedy that will be really fun .	1
( I guess according to her notes , all the parts were in ) she then said that bunk beds were never scheduled for evening deliveries because of the time it took to set them up ( does anyone know what their job is there ? ! ? )	0
She is the best Zumba instructor out there .	1
There is a light skinned lady by the name of ... that is very rude .	0
The open windows , TVs , bar and music are very lively and you can look in as you walk by .	1

I filed a complaint against them to the Better Business Bureau .	0
Unfortunately the taste was so overwhelming I lost my appetite immediately and asked for a refund .	0
Good , but not the greatest pizza , but a great time with friends .	1
These are not your typical triple fold large tortilla enchiladas .	1
Even though the food was great , we will not be back because of the employees .	0
A few eclectic things plus mainstream .	1
They now charge for dips instead of including them with each pizza , but the jalapeno ranch dip is so yummy , it is a must try !	1
When my husband began to try to explain that these are valuable things and he would not want to give them away for no reason , this employee of the company rudely told him that he could leave the plane then and stay at the airport .	0
ANYWAY ... I think overall , Paradise Bakery is a delicious place to find fresh food , maybe overpriced , but the atmosphere is nice .	1
The only reason why I 'm not giving them a 1 star is because they brought the food warm .	0
He was very personable , professional and most importantly helpful .	1
Great prices and wonderful food !	1
After 20 mins , no one showed up so I called again and another guy name Anthony answered the phone and I told him the situation and we had waited 20mins and no one had showed up .	0

Owner had excuses to give his staff , but would n't come out and speak with us .	0
awful .	0
If she didnt understand she should have asked me to assure it .	0
And please teach the woman in front the quantity she puts in the burrito is a joke .	0
The service was just UNACCEPTABLE .	0
Britney did explain that most of her new online appointments are very unreliable and a wasted scheduled 3 hrs that she can commit to someone else because they do n't normally show up .	0
SCAMMERS !	0

Waiters were subtlety rude and one even appeared flustered when we asked to order coffees after he brought us the bill .	0
There 's a mix of portobello , cremini , & oyster mushrooms with the amazing garlic white sauce and a generous amount of incredibly finely shredded white cheese .	1
I have been to Lago at least 10 times throughout my years of staying at the Bellagio & have enjoyed dining here for a quick meal or a `` date night '' with the BF .	1

The high prices , the lies , and the refusal to provide ingredients ... I will not be returning .... it was empty and we were the only customers ..	0

Once he went to actually take our order things went down hill .	0
Of course , that agreement was based on a bed of lies and a total misrepresentation of the facts and would never stand up in court .	0

Gyoza was solid and crispy .	1

And they will not stop charging my account .	0
Then we sit for over 15 minutes before we are approached by a waitress who was not ours to ask if we had been helped yet .	0
Absolute rip off if you ask me .	0

When they saw my records with previous high risk pregnancy and currently pregnant they refused to take ! ! !	0
We 'd go there all the time if there was : D	1
Whole staff is unethical and are cheaters .	0
I only heard about this place when I read some articles about the lawsuit where some of the unit owners are suing the developer .	1
They could not find connecting rooms and downgraded us to a different room so that our rooms were next to each other but not connecting .	0

Since I am doing a smaller sampler I ended up purchasing the small bags with the logo then printed my own Thank you logo for the brown vintage looking bags .	1
My mother and I was very shocked by her reply and we left the place .	0
But to accuse of stealing after getting a table after 2 and a half hours and starving is absolutely ridiculous .	0
We had to wait a while to get our bill from another server nonetheless , and even during payment she was nowhere to be found .	1
Very much worth it .	1
I have 2 days left and I would rather stay at a Motel 6 .	0

Thanks for taking an extra 20 minutes to close out my tab because you guys were called on unprofessional customer service .	0
I see a lot of bad reviews on maintenance so here is wishful thinking that they get this taken care of ASAP for me : D	1
And that 's a big problem , as they are totally disgusting .	0
Only redeeming factor is friendly and efficient staff .	0
TO DIE FOR !	1
but he acted like he did n't even care .	0
A business is there to make money , so someone taking up a table and not ordering anything basically costs them money .	1
The size portion is pretty large for small appetites , but I think for guys will be perfect .	1
They even provided samples of both the mac ' n cheese and cheesy potatoes in response when I asked for a recommendation .	1
Totally unsafe as water would splatter and pool outside the open area .	0
Everything was punctual and smooth .	0
The chorizo mac and cheese was inventive and provided a nice creamy flavour with just a hint of of spice .	1
I got the bruschetta and the Originals Salad in the junior size + Chicken and was absolutely stuffed !	1
Absolutely terrible customer service .	0
Crooks and liars : This has to be the biggest rip-off company ever .	0
They are very reasonable and include : all necessary shots , registration for dogs ( not puppies or cats ) , and a free vet visit .	1
Can i give no stars ?	0
But go for the great food .	1
Looks like they have all types of live music there , with a really nice outdoor setup .	1
I asked a few people they did try to help but after 40 minutes found nothing i was looking for .	0
very , very unique .	1
I 'm not sure you can really screw up on this , unless you do n't put enough sauce I guess in which case it could be bland ?	1
I will not be back at all I should of stayed in with my friend and order Pizza .	0
What sets it apart , the terrace balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains .	1
Needless to say I walked out empty handed with very disappointed children .	0
Very nice store , very cute clothes , I like !	1
If you 're looking for some sweet soul , this is the place ! ! !	1

I will say this , the staff is amazing , I will just never stay here again , for any reason .	0
Yes to a non-smoker it smelled terrible .	0
Dr.Hunsaker is very knowledgeable and thorough .	1
Lousy service and lousy stock considering the mark up .	0
I specifically told the person who answered and scheduled my appointment that I was not happy with the last visit and was told she would let management know .	0
This is by far my most favorite coffee shop to be .	1
It was quite good and the service was good as well .	1
Yum Yum Yum Yum Yummers !	1
Taste like home made Italian sauce with amazing veal !	1
The staff is incredibly polite and helpful .	1
RECOMMENDATIONS : There is a Thai lady who works there who I suggest ordering from because she is really nice .	0
Insert fork and knife , a gross salad soaked in Italian and room temperature bread straight from the super market down the road and you have the recipe for my Saturday night .	0
really funny and great magic acts , highly recommend !	1
They simply said , `` if your friend bought the dress online , she 's not our customer , she 's an online customer . ''	0
I just had a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !	0
But it made me 口齒留香！ super recommended to come here at least once for a breakfast in Vegas ! ! ! !	1
Those are the only things I order there bc they are so delicious I ca n't bare to order anything else .	1
Her response was that property is n't available to view for a few weeks even though the listing says available to view after 4/1 and today is 4/8 .	0
The worst part is she kept sitting people .	0
You should stay elsewhere for sure .	0
I also love all the women who work here .	1
The lunch menu was a little slim , and although great , I would have loved to have more pasta options .	1
The folks are disorganized .	0
I have been going for two years , and have seen incredible improvements in my back and hip pain to the point where I do n't have any pain , which is not usually easy given the extent of some of my injuries .	1
During the consolidation they made it sound painless and they would take care of everything told me if my creditors still harass me they will file a lawsuit against them for free ! !	0
The management and staff need an overhaul because they have no redeeming qualities at this point .	0
Ok that was ok when trying to pay , I was told that they did n't take `` Cash '' .	0
Had to request the soup to be sent back three times because it was not hot enough ( read : lukewarm ) .	0
It was soft and tasty .	0
Dr. Payne is professional and makes it easy to trust her with your vision .	1
Amazing meal and night as always - great for large groups , meat eaters and vegetarians alike and amazing beer selection .	1
The food at Ruth 's Chris is top notch .	1
Let it be said that I am not in shape and am not a huge fan of the outdoors , but I really liked this hike .	1
Yum !	1
WORST SERVICE EVER !	0
They would not come out unless I paid $ 150 I could not understand why I would have to pay for them to check out something they worked on .	0
I think not .. I will be pursuing this matter further with Pulte and maybe outside if there is no resolution .	0
The waitress totally ignored us , served the appetizer after the entree , when we said we did n't like it ... she did n't seem to care	0
Everything at Metro has been my favorite .	1
Not to be missed is the perfectly cooked and spiced calamari - which is a big enough serving to share with four .	1
Thank you Chunetil I will definitely be back ! !	1
Britney ( and her mom ) are an amazing duo who make the experience enjoyable !	1
He calls and the hostess tells him that they will leave it at the front desk .	0
She asked the clerk what was wrong , and the clerk told me to tell Kimberly what I had told her .	0
9.99 on the sandwich , total waste of money .	0
My husband really enjoyed the pork belly and ate most of it .	1
I waited for 15 minutes before they came to tell me that they were out of what I ordered .	0
The blue cheese pairs very well with the crispy bacon and juicy beef .	1
Very unhappy with this location .	0
They have a long list of other fun flavours that are gems .	1
I do n't like to deal with places that refuse to service their customers .	0
Lots of well blended flavours and textures .	1
Worse is that you learn no valuable information on the carousel .	0
My server was Amina she recommended fried pickles and I decided to try them as an appetizer !	1
I check and the new drug was still not ordered - knowing this was not my pharmacy 's fault I email again asking to speak to a supervisor .	0
I called the front desk and it took over 30 minutes for security to come .	0
But the first thing that needs to be fixed is atmosphere - simply by correcting the awful music situation that literally drove us away .	0
The flavor combinations here are amazing .	1
We visited the Mirazozo exhibit here , which was excellent .	1
I did n't have a chance to try the spring rolls but my siblings loved them and they are very picky eaters .	1
I was seen quickly and the staff was very nice , knowledgable and thorough .	1
Definitely get points for the nostalgia and the carts .	1
I thought that the included sauces ( I got theSpicy Mango and Choolah Fire ) really improved the chicken because it was n't coated in the masala so it brought more flavor to the chicken .	1
I met the owner tonight and he could n't give a ship ... wo n't go back ... terrible and self entitled ... yuck	0
We took home the peach cobbler and it was absolutely delicious right out of the fridge .	1
I will def go back .	1
She accommodated us happily and we were able to fit in an appetizer course , salads , entrees and dessert without being rushed or worrying about the time !	1
They billed my insurance company 1,233.00 for 2 physical therapy visits .	0
Our table and the table next to us got our food and we all had no silverware .	0
Third , the cocktails are great .	1

All in all this new managemnt is truly excedding my expectations !	1
The flight before us bound to Monterey , CA was delayed because a trainee was late .	0
Still stellar service and food !	1
Only saving grace was the ice cream .	0
Maybe I was looking for the wrong thing , but I do n't want to be told so bluntly !	0
The one big negative to the trip was when ( it appeared that ) one of the hotel security guards entered my room and stole two wallets while nobody was there .	0
After her bad behavior and rudeness the hotel offered me a $ 40 credit per room which I never used because I had planned my dinners for my family else where .	0
They use real fish sauce , and the papaya salad had all the elements of what can be found back home .	1
The egg rolls and food is delicious .	1
I was absolutely disgusted that I ended up cancelling my entire room and ended up getting a nicer room all the way on the other end of the strip .	0
The 'treuse was also excellent , and with rosemary incorporated into it it became really exceptional .	1
If 0 stars were possible , that would be the rating .	0
I should have listened to the reviewer from 11/1/2010 but I figured it must be ran differently a year later , NOPE .	0
Service was attentive and food arrived quickly .	1
Great food .	1
Great place for desserts !	1
He said we could dispute the charges with our credit card company later , but had to pay at the door if we wanted in .	0
It was so good .	1
A man who than claimed to be the manager told us all to 'get out ' .	0
By far one of my favourite all around restaurants .	1
This took a long time to get fixed , including some infuriating times when we were expecting a repairman who never showed up or called to explain .	1
Also , the guy who did my pedicure tried to clip my nail and then manually ripped off the corner and it ripped all the way to the root ; it was very unpleasant .	0
Such a great date night !	1
It ended up costing me around $ 800 in parts and labor to have the watch properly serviced and Dave 's and company 's mistakes cleaned up .	0
: - ) I 'm happy to eat an ice-cream cone in the car .... and I usually save a bit for the pup too !	1
The woman with the black hair Abby was very helpful , fun and informative .. but we did not care for Loud Crabby Ann the volunteer .	1
i said fine whatever i gave her the green sauce back she gives me the red , at this point its not even extra sauce .	0
Scott Roofing employees were all very helpful , honest and extremely hard working .	1
Then she added automatic gratuity , which is just unethical as she knew she did not earn a tip ! ! ! !	0
The coffee is horrible and the food sub-par at best .	0
I aske her to call my office and tell her when I leave work ... she calls AFTER I leave work .	0
After one customer service chat that was completely apathetic I got the same run around from rep number two that gave a snarky passive 'apology ' .	0
Moist and tender with great flavor .	1
So happy to have found our new vet	1
This place is terrible !	0
A complete rip-off .	0
Can you say crab legs at dinner oh yea ca n't forget about the oysters	1
But this place by far has the best salad I 've ever had , I 've had this salad multiple time and it never fails to satisfy .	1
I think for the room we did -- Vampires -- eight was a great sized group .	1
All food at table was uninspired at best .	0
I have always just gotten to-go but they are almost always packed inside so i assume the service is great too .	1
Let 's get an example please ; the LGBT community just celebrated Pride Week last week !	1
thought I 'd try it again on September 3rd 2015 and they still give no meat .	0
Extremely disappointed with service .	0
But that thing that mattered most was the room and it sucked and dirty ! ! ! !	0
WTF ?	0
Very disappointing .	0
Your mouth is watering right ?	0
I guess I 'm giving 2 stars because I feel sorry for the owners ?	0
Our experience was lovely and very enjoyable .	1
But it 's like they did n't even try , did n't put my mats back in place , left loose dirt in many many places and even the outside was left very visibly dirty .	0
The service sucked for this kind of a price tag , the owner was rude and barely spoke English .	0
The person I spoke with then said that they really should send out notification letters to members , but they do n't and that they get this all the time .	0
She checks the status and tells me in a snippy voice that she can give me $ 25 of it now .	0
The staff at this office is terrible !	0
She left the 90 % full beer sitting on the bar , even after I told her I thought it tasted off and pushed it away from me .	0
No kind of care , nor apology , bottom line it fell on deaf ears ..... mind you I set up my own beds and at the ends boxes were left in my walkway .	0
I left out the `` egg '' part just because I was n't feeling it but it was delicious .	1
I wanted to give them a benefit of the doubt so I tried again and asked for the correct email for the services I was requesting .	0
The cutting edge technology of turning a liquid into ice cream before your eyes is so cool !	1
I have tried two of his restaurants and been let down twice by the sub par quality .	0
YOU GET A REFUND FOR THAT ? ! ? !	0

What a deal !	1
She messed up my polish and had to ask her to come over and fix it .	0
The chicken had no flavour whatsoever .	1
Arizona has the largest number of identity theft in the nation .	0
Unfortunately , I did n't listen to the reviews before moving in regarding the concerns from previous tenants and had to pay a lease termination fee .	0
But when I asked for reimbursement of the medical expenses incurred , I was actually laughed at .	1
Staff here is terrible .. not friendly at all .	0
Very tasty pork buns , turnip cakes , and dumplings !	1
Have n't tried lunch or dinner but breakfast was yummy ! !	1
Takeout is super quick .	1
Thank you so much you guys are AMAZING ! ! !	1
WORST dining experience I can remember in years .	0
I took one star off because it is a bit dark and seems they need better organization , but if you have time to walk the store and keep an eye out , you will find some terrific bargains .	1
I do n't recommend this place to anyone .	0
Was then told that they do n't have any opening so it was Bethel Park or nothing .	0
Sadly I made sure they never give this business any business .	0
The food is HUMBLE and features some Jalisco dishes that many people are looking for , such as Bistec , Mole , Menudo , Birra , and Posole .	1
The price for this unpleasant dried up , not enough toppings pizza is distressing .	0
To make matters worse , the smell and stains did n't come out and they left my carpets SOAKING WET .	0
The Lucerne Chardonnay ( $ 17 a glass ) and it 's light , smooth , refreshing .	1
The employees were very rude and intrusive ( young black lady & older white lady ) I only gave 2 stars because this was the only locations that even had any shoes and I kinda like my vibrator lol	0
Spending $ 60 here felt like a ripoff because I ca n't help but to compare em to the buffet downstairs which is so much cheaper for quadruple the amount of food .	1
We had the best visit , so glad we came .	1
I will NEVER return to this location and have been sure to tell anyone and everyone I know to not waste their time at this location .	0
A solid four stars here .	1
Worst place ever .	0
I will not be back ever after having my ID taken away like that .	0
J Peters is one of my favorite restaurants !	1
Then my pizza was over cooked and burnt on the edges .	0
Hostess has a nasty attitude with an ugly smug that I would like to wipe off .	0
The dinner was promising at the start , but went downhill fast .	0
They use fresh fruit which is nice , and also have a 32oz size .	1
The burgers here are deliciously fresh with a slight char and toasted sesame seed bun .	1
WTF ? ! ? !	0
Will be back !	1
Tried calling to close the account July 11 at 17.00 and was answered after 25 min on hold .	0
NEVER EVER USE THIS COMPANY !	0
V confused about the reviews , Haberdish was overpriced and average at best .	0
Come and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere .	1
I will never return to this location .	0
The surf and turf was huge and the barramundi fish that I had was fabulous !	1
My favourite is their Shakshouka , which is poached eggs in a tomato , peppers and onions sauce .	1
This is a horrible facility .	0
So TL ; DR , L & J Motor Vehicle Services will get you in and out fast , keep you comfortable , and do it with a smile .	1
The steamroom , Finnish Sauna , two hot tubs with jets as well as cold plunge were great .	1
The service here is absolutely horrible .	0
They argue and argue until you give up .	0
Be aware and read before signing anything they will scam you with these ridicules made up charges .	0
Henne is truly the best in the 'burgh !	1
Love the breakfast tacos .	1
Any how , the service pretty much sucks .	0
A little gem on Queen West in Roncesvalles , this store has amazing dresses from every era and are for the most part all under $ 50 .	1
Great place close to stadium .... interesting taco choices , everyone in our group really liked the option they chose ... and good service despite being busy ... would definitely go back .	1
Unfortunately , this was my worst experience at a Starbucks ever .	0
My better half goes almost 2x/month and I try to get over whenever my schedule allows - the massages are continuously as incredible as they were that wonderful first time .	1
: )	1
If I could leave negative stars I would .	0
His price was very reasonable and well worth the little that he charges .	1
I told them no we 'll call later .	0
I had to ask for extra and it still was n't sub worthy .	0
I come to Dana park often for Ra Sushi and Costa Vida , and enjoy the Barnes and Noble here as well .	0
Otherwise it 's a ridiculously overpriced poor imitation of a real deli .	0
I paid him half the money right then .	0
I explored every option from treating ourselves to sealing our home , and decided to give SG a try based on their fantastic reviews .	1
This is know as Misleading Business Practice .	0
My honest opinion is that they are running a scam .	0
Amazing special sushi rolls .	1
Absolutely amazing .	1
I will not be returning to this place at all because of the way that they handled themselves while I was giving them extra on top of what I had already paid for .	0
I travel for work a lot and have stayed in plenty of hotels but this one is by far the worst hotel I 've ever stayed in , I wish I could give it negative stars .	0
All organic so prices are a bit high but their food is filling and definitely worth it .	1
The poor customer service and poor execution of the job has left a bad taste in my mouth .	0
The Service Department was supposed to be their saving grace .	0
Please drop by a pakistani resturant to know how REAL BIRYANI tastes like before you go offering such bland tasteless rice on the menu and calling it `` Biryani '' .	0
Taste and freshness has been top notch - I have n't had anything that I did n't enjoy from here .	1
I had the fish tacos , TERRIBLY FISHY .	0
There are many many places to go eat kbbq on Spring Mountain and I always come back here because of the great service and food .	1

DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE .	0
The sourdough bread and flavored butter were also a nice touch .	1
Gathered with a group for an appreciation dinner on the patio !	1
The food is delicious !	1
Before I list the reason this location needs more attention , I do want to point out that the customer service is amazing , and the workers are genuine and very courteous .	1
And on top of all that , they were breaded wings so you know that came out gross .	0
He went over a lot of the drinks with us , gave us his opinions on them and was super friendly and informative !	1
Since we could not communicate with this female , we proceeded to walk in and a male intervened and tried to help .	0
A restaurant denies you food because they do not have a smaller option Would not recommend this service .	0
It tasted like BBQ sauce on top of the specialty roll and the other roll had zero flavor at all .	0
I will not go there ever again , and do not recommend this place to anyone .	0
And some other horrible tasting fish .	0
I need to be rolled into bed # foodcoma I will be back MANY more times ! !	1
Never got a response .	0
This salon is amazing !	1
This clinic always seems busy , places you on hold for a long period of time and the staff members are unprofessional .	0
Definitely try to work this place into your weekly schedule , you wo n't regret it !	1
The syrup was repulsive .	0
We felt like we were bugging our waitress everything we ask for napkins or celery was n't bought out or our food was wrong just was n't a good vibe .	1
Great food , great service , great atmosphere !	1
Wo n't be returning .	0
I will never eat here again , and if you value your health ( raw meat ) you wo n't either .	0
This behavior is completely uncalled for by anyone no matter what store it is or what their position is .	0
GROSS .	0
Delicious and such a cozy atmosphere .	1
INSALATE - we balanced it with a very light , and refreshing CAVOLO NERO - kale and nuts , it was very well done , this is a great side dish to break up any richness of other dishes .	1
I had a cake tasting with a Drago Sister and she explained each flavor to me .	1
Never again .	0
Terrible experience !	0
I wish I could include pictures of their complete incompetence !	0
When we notified our server her response was they mix it up after they nuke it .	0
Overall , Surrender is one of my favorite clubs in the Vegas .	1
When bill came , they charged us $ 1.5 for that dish .	0
My visits have never been horrendously long either , or in and then out , so it 's nice to know I am not being rushed through to fit in patient after patient .	1
The waitress had the nerve to demand tip in the end which even made things worse .	0
So pathetic and sad .	0
I hope next time I come back I can do a reiki session or another session here !	1
Money well spent and will use again in the future ! !	1
Shout out to her for making my exchange as smooth as possible .	1
YUCK ! ! ! !	0
Thank you !	1
This place was alright when it opened but ... now it 's dirty and they have a bunch of kids working there with no respect and no idea what they 're doing .	0
Though never pleasant , I am so thankful I chose a surgeon I felt confident could fix whatever he might find once inside there .	1
He is very professional , does not push to have things done I am not comfortable doing , keeps me informed of everything I need done and the process in order to do those , and his chair side manner is top notch .	1
We ordered the dumpling burger which is a solid 5/5 and the danny California which is a 4/5 just because some bites were bland and some bites were SPICY !	1
Our server was hostile .	0
Is very rude unprofessional an very argumentative .	0
She went so quickly that she actually cut my pinky finger while filing my nails and I started bleeding .	0
It can get a little loud inside but overall this is a pretty average Starbucks that is great to have in the neighborhood if you want to just pick up your Starbucks favorites .	1
When we arrived at ticketing , the woman asked for our passports , did n't say hi , did n't smile , did n't make eye contact .	0
if you get hungry , there are plenty of asian candy/snack stores , aforementioned bubble tea shops ( many of which also carry food ) and the large food court to sate your appetite ( also follow your nose to the freshly made waffle snack stands ) .	1
The brownies were HEAVENLY , with whole smidgins of chocolate folded into the batter .	1
Once my go to lunch spot stinks for service .	0
Staffs behave as if they are owner of the apartment , they forgot what customer service is .	0
Customer service has gone downhill since Scotia took over .... wait times during non-peak hours during the day have increased from a couple of minutes to 20 minutes !	0
I have tried 7 salons in the northwest Vegas area since I moved here last year and I finally found a place that I am REALLY happy with .	1
You need to FOLLOW UP on a problem , FIRST before the sub gets blamed for ANYTHING .	0
Incredible Italian food .	1
THANK YOU !	1
Really disappointing .	0
I wo n't be returning to the San Tan location .	0
It was an issue of principle .	0
One of the best happy hour specials in the valley .	1
After waiting 20 minutes , I called back , and canceled , and the guy seemed like he could have cared less .	0
The sides are peeling I could literally pull the polish off , it 's cracked , it 's just a bad job .	0
But other then the desserts , the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms , Ahi Tuna Tartare , Stone Crab , Jumbo Alaskan Sea Crab , Chilean Sea Bass , New York Strip and Rib Eye did not disappoint our palettes .	1
We will be back !	1
The first time we had this burger it was amazing .	0
The jacuzzi half way the staircase was gross with stains and skin cells from the prior tenants .	0
This place is sooo awesome .	1
The burger was one of the best I 've ever had , or maybe the best .. .	1
I will not be back EVER ...	0
He tried scamming me outta more money than what he said my table cost .	0
We will never go back to Blondies and I 'd suggest others avoid it and get a better and cheaper meal somewhere else .	0
The service is always friendly and the good is just amazing .	1
My suggestion is spend your money elsewhere , and pretty much just avoid this place , I know I will be in the future .	0
Bought a dozen donuts and a chocolate croissant ( you 'd think you 're in Paris when eating that flaky beauty ! )	1
They said we would n't be charge , wow finally a break from the shittiness.When we were done with it the next day we called to get it picked up and NO ONE came .	0
People are nice and then inside is very clean .	1
It is two weeks after my hair was fried off and no heat has touched it , my hair has been drenched in deep conditioner , and is still forced to be worn half way up .	0
I was finally able to try it after catching a show at Planet Hollywood and it was pretty darn good .	1
I have tried luxury lashes in Wexford in the past and much prefer Deka !	1
The flank steak was very tender and moist .	1
I am ecstatic with the results and love my hair .	1
It was light but flavorful and not at all oily or greasy .	1
I really wanted to give them a 0 .	0
These simple additions really show they are trying to enhance the buffet experience as much as they can and that 's refreshing .	1
I love the orange chicken and spring rolls .	1
My cousin 's chicken sandwich was tasteless .	0
Food is COLD and tastes like it has been sitting around , Cold greasy pasta , cold burgers , cold greasy chicken wings , stale pretzels and cheese dip that smelled fishy and rotten .	0
We definitely wo n't be heading back here .	0
Simply fabulous .	1
They were not the fastest of all the casinos but they were not the slowest .	1
And the waitress was horrible .	0
I will not be returning .	0
The spa itself was clean but that 's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about this place .	0
This place is a joke !	0
* Pot of Tea $ 4.95 - I got the raspberry tea and had no complaints .	1
So long as I have this kind of expectation , I 'll never be disappointed , right ?	1
And the inside is exceedingly warm and welcoming , the kind of place you can sit all day , drinking coffee and perhaps working on that novel ?	1
I had the pie , which was really nice - my colleagues had burgers which they both enjoyed also .	1
Plus the venue is super small , will not be visiting cake again .	0
That being said eating here tonight has By far reached and exceeds beyond my expectation .	1
He told me he 'd reimburse me since I payed off the ticket .	0
Coming in past the normal lunch time on a Saturday afternoon , we found that there were not too many customers milling around , so plenty of seating was available .	1
Do n't regret it .	1
Recently had my daughter 's Bridal Shower at the Tearoom and what a wonderful celebration .	1
We definitely would not recommend this resort company to any of our friends or family we would not recommended it period ....	0
Everything was phenomenal and really packed the flavor .	1
Waiter made questionable remarks about not understanding my pronunciation of Portuguese items regardless that when he said them they were nearly the same .	0
The cheese curds are good but the wings are awful .	0
Thank you for a fabulous evening ! !	1
The truth is I was really disappointed .	0
What a wonderful pet supply store , I prefer it to any chain hands down .	1
We really will never go back .	0
They refused to provide any refund at first and I would have to come in in the morning to speak to a manager .	0
But I 'll never go back there again for sure .	0
The food is always fresh and they use the right amount of spices .	1
I love love love their drink selections .	1
Maria , when I had the opportunity to speak with her which took 3 phone calls to your office remembering that of those 3 , I was hung up on twice , stated that she did n't know anyone by the name of NICOLE or PATRICE .	0
4 visits , BS service and a continuing leak and no one to help us .	0
First time here was not a good experience - found a fly in my crab pot , 4 years later I thought I 'd give it another shot ... Big mistake !	0
Twice I have walked out because of having to wait so long to have my order taken or even to be acknowledged .	0
They are always friendly , humorous , and they make you feel as though you are part of their family .	1
Loved the strawberry liquid lunch .	1
The girlie who cut my hair was adorable , very much had to make sure my trim was exactly what I wanted .	0
They even have local craft beers .	1
Pls managers inform your employees to check the orders if they are complete before handing the order out to your customers .	0
Im more thrilled that my husband who is the worst possible food critic LOVES , LOVES , AMALFI PIZZERA ... ! ! ! ! !	1
I did n't even finish it which is rare , since I love chocolate pastries .	0
The desert was also awesome .	1
The quality of photos are amateur and disappointing .	0
Definitely recommend .	1
In my opinion , I was flat lied to by the sales person .	0
The place is a disgusting nightmare hole in the wall , being run by the most unprofessional woman in Las Vegas .	0
They were SO rude .	1
I was pleasantly surprised at this place .	1
By the time we had parked in a parking garage over the Andy Warhol bridge and walked to the museum ( maybe a ten minute walk ) , there were spots opened ... of course .	1
Things that you would put hard earned money for-not junk .	1
We enjoyed studying all the art pieces and drawing our own thoughts about it .	1
When the staff finally get around to taking my order , the associate gets easily distracted and ignores me halfway through me relaying the order to her .	0
Was this server telling me that this dessert was n't made on the premises ; was it frozen and just reheated on site ?	0

First impression walking in , I loved it ! ! !	1

Dismissive .	0
The egg roll was burnt .	0
; - ) The Peking Duck Baos were made well , a big enough piece of delicious duck ( not too fatty ) and the hoisin sauce in between the pillowy soft buns .	1

They are great with offering samples .	1

The friendliest store I 've ever been in .	1

The buttered cake with marscapone cream and scoop of ice cream was ah-mazing .	1
Besides that , the Pizza was still enjoyable .	1
Out of nowhere she literally yelled at me to move .	0

It 's one of my favourite fruits and they captured the taste ( and wonderful smell ) PERFECTLY .	1
The menu was a decent size and the food was delicious .	1
We will definitely be repeat customers .	1

The reason I tell people to stop at the dark , woodsy Yosemite hotel-like Silverton on their way INTO or OUT OF Vegas is mostly due to the must-see Outdoor World/ Bass Pro Shops connected to it .	1
Overall I would not recommend trying this place if you actually eat dessert , looking at pics on Yelp I thought everything was much larger that it actually was .	0
Service is incredibly slow .	0
We switched from Cox to Centurylink purely for the price of the internet .	0
For such a large city , this airport is truly disappointing .	0
I tried contacting head office again but it seems like it 's just a front and they do n't actually employ anyone there .	0

Huge help and took the time !	1
Incredibly overpriced for food that was nothing to write home about .	0

The manager is excellent .	1
It is worth the effort once you do arrive .	1
I thought I was going to hate this place because the hostess who greeted us seemed annoyed that we even entered the place .	1
Our server Toni was great .	1
Open mic nights , rotating drinks , burritos , good music , helpful staff , cool artwork , and a library make this place the amazing place that it is .	1
I called back because I found that the hang up was completely uncalled for .	0
When I asked - why no body bothered to call me back .. all she had to say was `` I 'm sorry '' in a very sarcastic way .	0
That guy definitely deserves a big hand !	1
The shrimp tastes microwaved and feels like I 'm eating gristle and fat .	0
The lighting in our room was pretty terrible as well .	0
The big plates of food ( Mojo Grilled Chicken , Arroz con Pollo , etc ) are alright , though not nearly as good as the sandwiches .	1

Always accommodating !	1
Beware this is NOT an American inn and ATM charges $ 8.95 to get cash there .	0
Ordered two Steak Quesadillas to go while passing through town , IT WAS DISGUSTING ! ! !	0
The employees here need to take their time and listen as well and turn the music down because clearly they ca n't hear a customer paying $ 15 for a burger and not getting what he paid for , it 's bogus .	0
I ended up scheduling my brow waxing here as well , and the hair ended up taking longer than expected , so she was able to do that as well .	1
The dessert they bring out was amazing .	1
Smh .	0
Overrated !	0

This time no wait , ordered breakfast and the food was Luke warm and not worth $ 40 for 2 people .	0
I 've followed Ruze on Instagram for about a year now and have been drawn in by its delicious posts of new treats .	1
A great place to catch up to that inner carnivorous primal foodie in you after a day of shopping or before you catch a film .	1
I think it 's a bargain !	1
My last two visits I ordered an asada burrtio to go and when I got home it was literally dripping grease .	0
Was refused a refund when I came in the next day and told I could only get them repierced .	0
I really ca n't wait to try other things on the menu .	1
I told the only staff member i saw and the response was `` oh '' .	0
As I was walking away the manager calls me a F * * * ing idiot and I yell back the same and he says he went to college lol .	0
His response was , `` we use a mix so if you order green peppers you get other peppers , and i 'll bet you $ 1000.00 there was no tomato on your pizza , you 're just saying that because you did n't like my pizza '' .	0
Btw , you can file a police report online for fraud at http : //www.torontopolice.on.ca/core/fraud_under.php	0

Nice selection of beers and cocktails and wine .	1

Having worked in the food industry for over 10 years in my teens and early 20s I try to give the benefit of the doubt but the there is no excuse for what we saw there and our experience .	0
Nothing really flashy , just a simple , neat place .	1
With the caveat that service is a bit quirky and Akita has the feel of a first-time restaurateur , I would recommend it for good food and value .	1
I am a mexican food lover so I stuck with things on the Miexican portion of the menu , a few different tacos ( barbacoa and carnitas ) both of which were amazing , the beef just melts in your mouth it is so tender .	1
The anesthesiologist knocked me out while I was yammering about my love of peanut butter and the procedure was over before I realized I was ever under !	1

In the long run , we should have just paid the few extra dollars to go to a reputable car company .	0
The technician was too busy talking to another technician to May any attention to the uneven stroke marks .	0
At least the waitress had the decency to inform me up front that Long Islands would be $ 16 .... a piece ! ! ! ! !	0
The lady at the counter had earphones in and clearly could n't be bothered to care - just wanted to keep it transactional .	0
It was my first an LAST EXPERINCE there the way he lady was pulling on my daughter hair it was awful , I always try to see the good on the bad , but this one is nothing good !	0
Tucked in a little strip mall by a Safeway store and a couple of other restaurants phoenix pfresh lives up to its name .	1
The food was exquisite .	1
The staff was super friendly and it was n't crowded [ so maybe I just missed the lunch rush ? ] .	1

No this is no dive bar it is a great neighborhood bar , clean and friendly with decent bar food and I am not bombarded by loud sports but insted a good jukebox .	1
I was very disappointed because I had a high opinion of the restaurant .	0
After my experience with them , I would definitely not hesitate to use them again and recommend them to anyone looking for borders and curbing .	1

10-15 minutes if there is no Email notification .	0

Recently I took a friend there for lunch and the food was luke-warm , and barely edible .	0
Not only does Tara do a great job with my hair but she offers a good selection of quality product at a reasonable price .	1
No casino in the lobby of the Signature Suites , but you will find a Starbucks !	1
The guy at the register was very rude charged me extra and then lied about it ... the woman displaying the food in the shelf were not even wearing gloves !	0
He never received a call back , so the assumption was that the reservation was alright .	1
There is never any utensils available , condiments are always empty , and the floors are always very dirty .	0
The inside particularly is really nice !	1
The watress comes over and picks up the bills and says `` zero on tip ? `` .	0
Note the pix of the toilet in the master bedroom , especially disappointing .	0
It is by far the most I paid for sunflowers and I will never return to Terry .	0
The only downfall for me is that it is cash only .	1

If you are used to eating Indian Food then do not bother with this place .	0
To my suspicion they half assed the job at the last minute , after all they told my insurance company it was done , when I went to retrieve my vehicle it was not , to find out it would be done by end of day .	0
This woman refused to give me her last name after I asked even though she claimed to be the manager of this resturant .	0
My sandwich is skimpy on the content and was served on a stale baguette .	0
Oh and by the way I forgot to mention that the artist was also dressed in a very unprofessional way and was wearing sweat pants and had her hair in a messy bun looking like she just woke up out of bed .	0
I have been at least three times and the food never disappoints .	1
I confirm my feeling of never going there right : ) first impression , unprofessional .	0
Sushimi was probably the worst quality I 've ever had .	0
Watched my burger made incorrectly twice .	0
This place sucks .	0
The only good thing was their all you can eat fresh bread , although we got one that was still frozen in the centre so that was a little off putting .	0
The bathtub is barely able to fit one small woman and the grout in the shower was peeling .	0
Yes , its long ; but it also moves relatively quick .	1
highly not recommended take your business elsewhere even at the cost of further transportation .	0
Also , in the past year I have n't tried a bento-box so I no longer feel up to the task of evaluating them ; nevertheless , the sushi remains excellent , of high quality , and is provided in generous portion sizes .	1
Already talked to our credit card company and filing police report per their suggestion .	0
Service is horrible !	0
The employees are always friendly here and most of the people walking in and out seem to be regulars since they talk to the employees like long time friends .	1
Good stuff must try ! !	1
Overall , it was the best experience we have ever had .	1
Avoid this location at all costs .	0
The customer service is amazing !	1

Overall , great place to try box braids .	1
15 min later I get all of my food drive home to find out my order was messed up yet again .... i wo n't be going back anytime soon .	0
This is what real yoga should be .. Yoga is not really a workout , if you want to sweat and detox , you can go to a step class , a kickboxing class or even get on the treadmills ...	1
I told this person of my situation and she said it was a general line and not that store ( even though that store phone was in my caller ID ) .	0

Also after waiting for a very very slow order .. then finally get to front and the cashier takes a phone order for 7 minutes .	0
We came in around 9 pm and it was n't super busy , but there were several messy tables just sitting there and no silverware at our table .	0
Mike even gave us personal references for some of the fixes for our house too ... even a week after the inspection when we emailed and asked ! ! !	1
After the first shot passed through my lips ... I had flash backs of eating lychee right off the trees in our backyard in Hawaii .	1
After a short time the tech decided I needed a motor , I did not buy it any he left , I paid $ 95 service call .	0
I believe this bread will be sold in the next few weeks in their retail space but we were very lucky to take some delicious olive and nut infused bread home with us and was thoroughly enjoyed the next few days in my household !	1
I take issue with a business who happily collects their fees upfront and consistently fails to deliver a quality product on time .	0
I never got a call back .	0
Anyways I probably wo n't return to this location for quiet sometime , I love the other locations I 've been to tho .	0
I was disappointed that I did n't see some of my Western NY favorites ( Vernor 's ginger ale , loganberry and haddock fish fry ) but was very happy with the pizza we ordered .	1
Delicious looking food coming out of the kitchen ... Come here and enjoy the quiet , cool , relaxing ambiance ... ( Before the Pirates come back to town !	1
Absolutely disgusting .	0
I would highly recommend this place if you 're near the strip and looking for a delicious and filling meal .	1
The croissants and eclairs are to die for !	1
My only gripe would be getting my order wrong , which still turned out to be a pleasant surprise .	1
The guy taking orders needs to learn to speak to the people handing him our hard earned money .	0
Mushroom fried rice was bland and tasteless !	0
It 's impossible to call the front office because NO ONE EVER ANSWERS , EVER .	0
It 's insane to think that in 2017 you can pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to a supposedly honest company for a product and experience and then be totally screwed over with absolutely no recourse .	0
I 'd certainly go back , and might someday try a cupcake .	1
Great selection and yes they have it in stock ready to go in my case .	1
Wyndam/Baymont did reimburse the room cost , but no objective answers to what did or will be done to rectify the rotten customer service and bad reviews for this franchise .	0
Club is Overrated .	0
The restaurant was messy- lots of tables to be cleared and the worst was the restroom .	0
I 'll definitely go back for dinner buffet next time .	1
Robin Hood mentality and bait and switch .	0
So disappointed .	0
Stay away at all costs ! !	0
I travel a lot & this is the worst place I have ever stayed .	0
Great pizza , different from the rest !	1
The bread was fresh , the roast beef moist and tender , and the horseradish slaw just made the sandwich a knockout winner .	1
My only criticism would be about the fries .	1
On m'avait conseillé de prendre le medium , chose que j'ai faite et nous avons aussi commandé des cornichons , des frites , de la salade de choux et des coca-cola pour avoir le repas le plus typique qui soit .	1
Food is all spectacular just a bit unusual shrimp Caesar incredible tons of tiny shrimp .	1
The spumoni and caramel were excellent .	1
The girls who do the lashes are personable and friendly as well as knowledgable .	1
I loved how the party package was all-inclusive with the use of the facility as well as food , cake , candles , utensils , drinks etc etc etc-no hidden costs or surprises .	1
I received a confirmation e-mail saying that it would be 30-40 minutes until delivery .	1
Good service !	1
Ca n't wait to go there again .	1
`` This place is awesome .	1
Overall it was stuffy and out-dated I would NOT go back .	0

The grill smells great and I love sitting near it to watch all the kitchen action .	1
Flavorful and perfect serving size .	1
The staff and hair stylist were very welcoming and nice !	1
They have hot or cold subs my favorite sub is the philly cheese steak they always make it perfect i would recommend coming .	1
I 've also seen Dr. Argawal and Britta a few times and they 're just as amazing .	1
Believe me , it is not so easy to find decent fresh croissants .	1
Regal Cinemas also has the Regal Crown Club , and as a member you 'll earn points on all purchases , including the bar !	1
Do yourself a big favor and never take your car to this incompetent unprofessional baby !	0
This was truly the most exceptional set course dinner .	1
Oh and they make the pizza super fast - yet with all the greatness of a brick oven .	1
The reason I 'm awarding it 5 stars is the attention to detail .	1
I like that they also have a handful of Trivial Pursuit cards at each table to help keep the table entertained while waiting for food or while kicking back a few drinks ..	1
However , when the beer arrived my friend 's glass was literally covered in lipstick marks .	0
We had an awful experience .	0
I was very impressed by Levi , his workmanship is top quality , he works very quickly and thoroughly and had really competitive prices .	1
I just found out a nice Indian restaurant in my new neighborhood .	1
After 15 minutes without even being acknowledged , we left .	0
What a piss poor job of casino management ...	1
Tonight I got my food to go and was very disappointed .	0
The servers are friendly , personable and informative .	1
My go-to coffee spot in the area is The Common on Bloor , but I was hungry today so stopped here for a sandwich .	1
Terrible experience with the service manager here and total lack of respect from both he and the GM over the damage they did to my car .	0
Especially when you 're treated very well when visiting other hotels in the area .	1
So far it 's been my fave buffet in Vegas .	1
Also , the staff was awesome and friendly ... did n't realize I had to call ahead so they actually checked and pulled it all from the shelves for me !	1
Never again .	0
I had French Toast , eggs , bacon ... yummm !	1
I made a note to self that we must have dinner here with the Hawaii fam bam .	1
Fantastic food .	1
Seriously rude servers - only 1 of 3 acknowledged we existed , and the one who did had the most astonishing attitude problem .	0
The soup base was n't overly rich and half cooked egg was amazing .	1
If not you get angry customers that walk out , never to return and spend their hard earned money with you again .	0
Poorly executed front of house .	0
Price point - 3/5 This is a fancy upscale place and so drinks and food tend to be on the pricier side .	1
Just a lot of lies and poor customer service .	0
Go for the shrimp dumplings - very fresh and delicious .	1
Incredible selection in the food cabinet !	1
The worst airline ever .	0
Laid-backgammon , efficient and very good soups and sandwiches : original and very tasty !	1
It was stolen by the employees who then went shopping with it and racked up 500 dollars in charges .	0
Great food !	1
The inside and the outside garbage cans were overflowing and the manager was ignoring that fact so there was no where to clean up after yourself .	0
Yet no apologies from them .	0
Both of them warmly greeted me when I walked in to order to-go .	1
Sushi was tasty and fresh .	1
I will more than likely stay away from this place for sometime and try it again in a couple of years again .	0

It is awful .	0
Owner was rude !	0
It was pretty gross .	0

I love good kimchi and sauerkraut so I have no aversion to pickled cabbage on it 's own .	0
and JOHN was so helpful .	1
Service was attentive , helpful and friendly .	1
We wo n't be back .	0
If someone gives a bad review on this place , take it to the bank ; they 're clueless .	1
It has a good layout ...... TV if you want to watch a game ... and great selection of beers with cold glasses .	1
You can also get a salad instead of fries so that 's a big plus when you want to eat a bit healthier than you can at a typical burger joint .	1
The restaurant is adorable and cozy .	1
But you failed at that and did n't seem to give a crap .	0
I 'm very happy with the results and will be using their services again !	1
This place is very unaccommodating and rude !	0
The place is the bomb ! !	1
I ` m a huge fan of ODIN and was delighted to see Thor when I moved to the neighbourhood .	0

Terrible service !	0
If you are on the other side of town , trust me it is worth the drive !	1
I have to say thought my favorite was their bread pudding .	1
It was amazing !	1
Also , the puke in the elevator , trash thrown around just overall disregard for the property by these college students is pretty rampant .	1
For dessert , we could n't decide between the warm berry crumble and the creme brulee so of course we had to order both .	1
Even the appetizers and karaage chicken are delicious , worth every penny .	1
The food was superb .	1
The owner is very nice and professional .	1
Veal and ricotta stuffed pasta - the mans favorite .	1
The staff was rude and not helpful at all .	0

Again , I asked to speak to the manager and told him that the hotel was correct when it said the restaurant was responsible for honoring its contract , and I would deduct the $ 13 from payment .	0
The server begrudgingly made another place setting before barking , `` Just sit down here , because if you move and the order gets screwed up , it 's going to take me , like , fifteen minutes to fix . ''	0
The bartender was extremely friendly and gave great beer suggestions .	1
Apparently my boyfriend did n't want mayonnaise ...... Because he was afraid that it would fatten him up ... this is completely our problem but they still tried to explain to us whyvmayonnaise could n't be waived .	1
I took it back the following day , a new quart was issued and it was the complete opposite , it had no flavor and tasted like water .	0
The portions are large and you will not leave hungry .	1
I would not visit T-Bones again which is a very disappointing statement to make for many reasons not the least of which was I thought that I had enjoyed it more until I evaluated my experience by that statement .	0
Horrible place to stay .	0
This location is doing something right and I recommend !	1
I will visit here again and again !	1
Great specials and plenty of TV 's inside and out to watch games .	1

I ate at Morels for dinner last weekend and I will say it was one of the worst dining experiences of my life .	0
The thought of posting a review did n't cross my mind until an older lady walked up after us ( she was obviously hard of hearing ) and the cashier repeated herself 3 times , each time her tone got more snappy and rude .	0
Egg Works has always exceeded our expectations .	1
Great food !	1
And their prices are very reasonable .	1
She has been digging through records that date back to 2007 to find receipts for items that were stolen .	1
Would definitely order the Croque Madame & those light , crispy lemony Madeleines again .	1
She did n't have to say anything , she gobbled it up .	1
Highly recommend .	1
It was kind of gross and really irritating .	0
Friendly staff too !	1

Of course a great restaurant to enjoy all kinds of sea food dishes .	1

We asked for water three times and it took 20 minutes to get to us .	0
All of their staff were very friendly , and the design/atmosphere inside is vintage/chic ... with lots to look at = ] Each of their stylists has a different rating and price ( which you can find on their website or on their store front ) .	1
After peeling it to get to the shrimp the shrimp inside had no flavor .. all the flavor was on the shell and the outside .	0
Horrible .	0
STAY AWAY !	0
Their hot wings with standard sauce were outstanding .	1
There was never any apologies , or empathy about how long the food took to come , and on top of that , before 3 girls in our party even got to order they told us we were no longer allowed to order food ...	0
I love this place and the people working here !	1
I fulfilled my contracted time and when I tried rectify my over abundance of water they still billed me for the use of the cooler which was supposed to be mine after the original contract .	0
I also tried some of the sweets , they were sweet and had the amazing taste .	1
The staff is awesome .	1
I finally got in touch with the office ( after Groupon ) & it took a while for the doctor to even care enough to get back to me ... waking me up , so she finally said she would call me back , which she did n't .	0
The only redeeming quality was the patio , which was fairly well tucked away from the street , considering the surroundings , and the waitress .	0
I saw Korn last night at this venue and was very disappointed because I could n't see anything .	0
Simply outstanding and as good as I have had anywhere .	1

The patty was bland and seemed like the pre cooked then microwaved the patty .	0
The ricotta inside the lasagna was absolutely perfect .	1
Dining area and decor is modern and fresh .	1

Our server knew a lot about each dish and the little details about it , which is what earned the two stars .	0
All the ladies were super friendly and smiling .	1
Coach Francisco was very knowledgeable and helpful .	1
I will never go back there again an i will tell my friends an more word of mouth an e-mails ..	0
Company is a complete joke with HORRIBLE customer service .	0
I went here last Saturday and I was a great experience !	1
I had little hope of a pleasant experience as the hostLESS , who looked straight at me as I walked in , was too busy conversing with another employee to even acknowledge our arrival , much less seat us promptly .	1
walking in , the atmosphere was already negative , probably from slow & bad service .	0
Very recommended .	1
But the fact that the associate entered the information into the computer incorrectly should mean that it is not our fault and Lowe 's should be willing to correct their mistake .	0
The gyro was sizeable and delicious , and the fries were crispy .	1
I suppose he never called me back because he realized that he was one of the two men who worked on my car .	0

Stanley 's is one of my favorites .	1
The waitress is horrible and she was very rude most of the time .	0
However both the ladies and gentlemen 's facilities were not on the same level ( out of soap , overflowing waste bins , dirty floors and non flushing fixtures are not acceptable at any time for a restaurant ) .	0
Bosses are understanding , new/this guy SUCKS !	0
I only wish this place was open later !	1
Never again .	0
When we went to advise the staff she became defensive .	0
I would happily eat here again .	1
My advice is do n't make my mistake of not sending a dish back at this place because your going to get charged full price regardless .	0
It 's unfortunate that their staff is unprofessional but , moreover , disheartening that they were judgmental , rude and disrespectful .	0
At that point we had waited another 10 minutes hoping to at least get our drink order taken but nope that did n't happen .	0
Would not recommend using them to anyone .	0
I 'll be back : ) !	1

I left very dissapointed with the treatement i got for his crappy day he must have had .	0
The restaurant is tucked away into a tiny strip fairly close to downtown Charlotte and the atmosphere is hole-in-the-wall but very comfortable .	1
You cut off a bunch of people as you ran a stop light !	0
They seem to be a bunch of catty , gossiping ladies with little to no concern about patients rights , nor booking or canceling appointments .	1
Jessica personally delivered a beautiful blueberry argyle cake the day of the event .	1
I would not hesitate to recommend Zen Windows Charlotte to family and friends .	1

I closed my legs upset ... then he threw the towel back over my legs and went back to my feet .	0
While I was definitely satisfied , but not extremely overwhelmed with my food , it 's really the atmosphere and set-up of the entire Sienna Mercato is really what makes it stand out in downtown Pittsburgh .	1

And then even when I asked for someone to fix it he appeared 1 hour later when we were checking out .	0
Although Amazon refunded the money for the `` lost '' items immediately and promised to investigate the incident , I have doubts that this will make a difference either .	0
It took 5 minutes to sprint there with my stuff , and when I got there the bus already left .	0
I would definitely come back again !	1
Meanwhile the staff told us `` please enjoy the entertainment and great service . ''	0

But considering the shoddy money-is-everything feeling that surrounded my quiet weekend vacation , I certainly do n't intend to return to this money-grubbing black hole anytime soon .	0
As for other food : Their sweet potato fries are delicious , too !	1
The weekday buffet is allot cheaper and very tasty and the Friday-Sunday buffet is out of this world !	1
It 's cool that they offer Dole Whip because usually I only see it at festivals and it 's expensive at special events .	1
Best spring rolls in town .	1

They are crooks and have a web of support who defends and protects them .	0
As an introvert who gets nervous at group dinners , the chef 's dinner was so much fun and low-stress .	1

It was clear that the manager was n't going to listen nor was he going to solve the problem .	0
If you 're indecisive or still learning , there are some interesting flights at the back of the menu that again range from an accessible try ( $ 19 or so ) , to the super premium ( $ 100 or so ) .	1
It took 15 minutes just for someone to come to our table to say hello .	0

-Chicken strips are very tasty , juicy , and a must try -Seasoning of the strips is unique .	1

The best pool on the strip .	1
I wish I could give this hotel a ZERO .	0
The only down side is that you can hear other people getting dressed and the door opening .	1
But on top of all that , Raul and Theresas has simply gone downhill , with slow service , less than sparkling clean silverware ; smaller portions not matching the menu descriptions and prices , which simply do n't justify what you get .	0
This place needs to shut down immediately , I have never seen worst customer service	0

Incredible and just the right amount of heat .	1
I quickly realized then that no one who has been in front of us had gotten their food yet and there was no sense of urgency to get anything out quick .	0
- BURGUNDY SNAILS IN GARLIC HERB BUTTER , CROUTONS , CONFIT TOMATO , PARMA PROSCIUTTO - a classic French dish and a must order .	1
I especially like that they offer saag for lunch , which is something I do n't always see .	1

When we told her that the order was messed up , she rolled her eyes and started clearing up my cousin 's dish while he was still eating it ( my cousin later told me that his vermicelli was not cooked properly ) !	0

So disappointing .	0
The young African American female seater told my hunsband he was being hostile .	0
We left and will never come back to this horrible excuse for a restaurant ever again !	0
You really ca n't go wrong .	1
My goal is to try every flavor !	1
But the food and drinks are a little pricier than what I would want to spend at a sports bar .	1
I payed 130 $ for a full detail and they did n't clean the car correctly .	0
& I 'm a very picky girl !	1
Also the people are super friendly when you walk in they 're really great .	1
It 's so much fun it does n't feel like a work out .	1

When I tried to interact with whoever answers the emails and the phone , I was treated very rudely .	0
The Burger Patty on it 's own was charred nicely with that charbroil flavour and was seasoned well enough .	1
Also when the guy started working on my nails , the ladies working there started having very loud argument .	0
Very disappointed me !	0
The cake inside was heavenly soft and moist .	1
yuck !	1
To me , the management should have offered to return my money or at least offer me a gift card for the next visit .	0
Well cute is about all it is ... from the terrible chipotle salsa to the hard , cold rice and beans to the lack luster waiter .	0
Perfect dog-friendly restaurant in Vegas !	1
My partner and I moved to Toronto from Montreal a little over a year ago , and we have been struggling to find a classic diner that we really enjoy .	1
Soup was incredibly good .... nice and hot .	1
The gel was layered on , they did n't clean her nails , just a horrible experience all around .	0
Had the most warm , lighthearted and hilarious vibe .	1
They 've always been able to accommodate large groups for us and their patio is great for dining outside .	1
With that said , I am totally pleased that the former staff members remain as that is helping to ease the transition .	1
Two thumbs up !	1
The isle 's are a bit narrow but I walked freely without hitting anyone so they are wider than a movie theater .	1
The restaurant was spotless .	1

These guys were down the best movers I have ever hired .	1
I called their `` customer service '' and was told I would have to pay yet another $ 79 to have a technician come out and fix the problem they left when they came out to replace the brine tank .	0
Apparently they only have 1 technician in the entire company and he quit .	0
If anyone from corporate bothered to check on this store they would be FIRED in two seconds .	0
Do not recommend using this business .	0

Ugh never coming here again .	0
We left She was rude , spend my money where I 'm appreciated .	0
`` Hey liar , you 're lying .	0
Tried to book an appointment but the lady at the front desk was rude and unhelpful .	0
I think that tipping is not mandatory and it 's rude of her to ask for more tip when the service and food was not worth it at all .	0
I 've tried a handful of combinations already and the broth and noodles actually taste pretty good !	1
I recieved no courtesy call explaining why the order was canceled .	0
Service was very slow and food was mediocre .	0

I tried eggs with chorizo and huevos rancheros , both come with different sides like beans , tortillas , bread , etc .	1

Light fluffy cakes with equally fluffy frosting , filled with , maybe , the best cassata filling I 've had .	1

This would n't be the first time I was fed wrong information by this manager .	0
Oh yeah I can let you all know they stole over $ 15k worth of stereo equipment and tools from my van .	0
The workers will scam you on extra fees and the company will back them up .	0
Never talk badly about other businesses and never make your potential customers feel inadequate because you had an issue with the company that referred them .	0
They will seat only groups with all the members there for quicker service to other groups , and sitting under the misters on benches in a shaded area makes waiting easier .	1
Have fun ! !	1
The chicken sandwiches were huge with quality toppings .	1

The two hour wait was well worth it !	1
Tasteless , greasy gravy that had congealed before reaching the table .	0
I will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE IN MY LIFE .	0
It is absolutely filthy .	0
I can understand mistakes when a waitress is very busy , but being obviously ignored when she only had one other table was just too much .	0
We were expecting to at least have a good lomo saltado , a flamed moist meat mix with the onions still crunchy and tomatoes hardly cooked , but flavor was ok to marginal .	0
I had the steak tips ( my favorite from this place ) .	0
The dish also came with butternut squash purée , very creative but again , I got soggy bread , creamy mushroom and now purée , it 's just all too much moosh .	1
I had been to other massage places before but this one was so well organized .	1

I absolutely love this place .	1
Just so happen every time I come to Hyundai services , Derek is always the guy to help us !	1
Chile verde is amazing and the California omelet is above exceptional .	1
I would never stay here again .	0

Sometimes I have questions on how a higher or lower string tension would help me and he shares recommendations and insights with progressive sensibility .	1
Needless to say do n't waste your time here .	0
This kind of breaks my heart giving this place a drop in the love category .	0
I wo n't be giving them a 2nd chance sadly ...	0
* * YUCK * * Again , it 's raw food ! ! !	0
I will never go back and would recommend avoid at any cost !	0

The organization is one of the few authentic `` homegrown '' groups that truly supports the community .	1
I went and talked to the people on the front desk and told him what happened .	0
Worst location ever .	0
The bar is elevated and slightly away from the dance floor so it makes getting drinks easier , and the bathrooms are much more accessible than Tao .	1
I wanted to go into the back and tell the owner that he created a worst dining experience than every other bad dining experience I 've had , combined .	0
And under the influence of alcohol it only gets worse , one such guy in front of us was downing some weak sauce Budweiser and as the minutes passed ; he seemed to get agitated trying to start something with us , before anything happened we decided to move .	1
The service is slow , the servers are rude , and the food looks/tastes like it 's been blasted dry in the microwave .	0
I ca n't wait to dig into the pork sandwich that I got to go !	1
However the server was very rude and unhelpful ... Wow !	0
Beside the food was just ok. We will not be back .	0

It 's really a shame , because with better management this place could be great .	0
i love this place ( during the summer ) because ... - one .	1
It 's a joke that the owner hired those people .	0
Just a note that I overheard the manager at WHB tell a customer that when he was training staff , he used Yelp to find out what things employees should not do !	1
THey also calculated how much time they needed prior to the event , and they came exactly on time !	1
This was literally THE worse eggplant PARM dish Ive ever had .	0
The theatre is fairly small and intimate so everyone has a nice vantage point .	1
Again , I will not be back to this restaurant and I would encourage you to save your time and money and go somewhere else .	0
My only recommendation to Michelle is too humble herself before she runs out of business !	0

No ambience but one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town .	1
Every area of the park had some type of fun activity taking place .	1

We then proceeded to wait 15 minutes without any menus or water , while we attempted to catch the waiters attention .	0
The owner is so kind and helpful .	1
The bartender Cat and the server Brandon were especially nice .	1

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE .	0
A fabulous addition to the Tremont area is Merchant Street , with the owner present and welcoming as we sat down to dine .	1
Its more of a nice ( very large ) bar with 20 or so bowling lanes if you 're so inclined .	1
I 've had take out , a Sushi boat and A lunch Bento Box from here and I have no complaints .	1
Even if I move back to Madison I will never utilize this studio again .	0

When they see topless girls ... they start going crazy by hooting , hollering , and making disgusting comments .	1
Extremely authentic Asian food .	1
They clearly did n't see me as a priority and it was depressing .	1
As such all units in this complex suffer for anemic to outright depressing low levels of natural light , even though my unit was almost all four/five feet windows across from end to end .	0
Love it !	1

This is by far my favorite Mexican food place in phx , I always overeat and have plenty of leftovers the next day .	1

The open gym , art/music rooms , and lavatory are always clean and organized .	1
large portions !	1
All of them were devoured without even an offer for anyone else to have a bite .... I had their roasted veggie quiche of the day , which also came with a side salad , plus a fresh pressed green juice .	1
I first visited this place when they opened a few years ago and then again recently I have to say the quality of the food and the menu have both gotten better and many of the dishes are very very good .	1
I make order and they said wait we still have something not coming yet .	0
I went back in and told the cashier what happened , and asked her for some napkins to stanch the blood .	0
The space has an authentic cantina character .	1
However , 10 minutes has gone by and nothing happened .	0
Worst bar in Scottsdale bartenders are so rude .	0
The fun little rapids were never too wild , just exciting .	1
Just lame the girl did n't even looked at it well she was 5 feet away from checking the item .	0
Everytime I come here , i know exactly what to expect ... perfection !	1

I wish I could give minus stars .	0
Highly recommended	1

Buyer Beware .	0
It would have probably be a good time to see that as a warning but unfortunately we made the mistake of not cancelling our food order .	0
When I called PODS to file a complaint , the manager was rude , totally defensive and denied it .	0
There were only 4 people in front of me and this ordeal took 20 minutes !	1

Large portions of delicious food in a nice atmosphere served by a very attentive staff .	1
Save your money , and do n't even bother to try this guys .	0

The fish broth has a very distinct flavour that can be customized eg ... garlic broth .	1
The concept in my opinion is great !	1
If I had to sum it up , it 's a smaller version of Zumanity , but without the full frontal nudity ( Absinthe uses pasties ) .	1
Their customer service is horrendous .	0
If you 've never tried this cross between ice cream and shaved ice , it can be a surprising and somewhat odd thing to process at first .	1

Then he passed me down the line and the next person screwed up my order by putting the dressing is asked for on the side right into the bowl .	0
I was told I had to provide a physical address or they would not come .	0
Basically , I would not recommend this place to anyone .	0
It was delicious and very reasonably priced for what was offered in the buffet .	1

Many families bring picnic baskets .	1
Jasmine was pleasant and checked on us often .	1
Although the pizza was good - lots of flavourful toppings and really filling ( I could only eat half ) - I found it a little too salty and the crust was a bit too dense for my liking .	1

Food was n't good , tried to over charge us , delivery driver was extremely rude .	0

and last but not least our 21.00 spinach artichoke dip from the spa was laughable it was more like soup with chunks of spinach and artichokes and stale chips .	0
In conclusion , this place will definitely satisfy any pizza cravings that you may have !	1
He is so nice and friendly !	1
The chicken was bland .	0
Philly/Chicken Philly Pitas are legit , original Pitas are SOOOO good and the spanakopita is BOMB !	1
Overall very good .	1
Make reservations for sure because this location gets very busy !	1
What a waste of time and money .	0
Then she tells me to jump out and ask one of the other cabs , in the overcrowded valet area with everybody honking , to see if they have change .	0
Four stars for best broth .	1
The steak was dry and pretty tasteless and the eggs were just eggs nothing special .	0
This place and the employees were ok , it was dealing with delivery that was the most upsetting .	0
She was not welcoming to us asking a question or requesting a service that might get her out of her routine .	0
BurGR 's is fantastic .	1
He tries to scare customers and start repairing WITHOUT customer 's approval .	0
never going here again !	0
We would go back though just because the food was so good !	1
When I explain to them that the entire experience had been very frustrating and after paying TWICE for a dishwasher to get delivered and installed I in fact have received that service ZERO times , they do n't seem to care that much .	0
They make their own home made hot sauce wich is really tasty and hot .	1
The ones that were have just really appalled me .	0
When I tell you this guy must of been on something it was ridiculous .	0
We told her we needed putters for two and she said okay $ 17 dollars .	0
They have a great variety of nigiri and their rolls are great .	1
We give George and his company 5 Stars !	1
They will not call you back after you talk with them and they say they will .	0
We remember when this cafe was really great , but 5 years ago , we had the slowest service ever and quit going after the movies .	0
The only way to communicate with the management is through emails , they are not prompt to respond and do n't care about dealing with complaints , refunds , etc .	0
Please change your business hour , this is very frustrating because I had to drive 20 mins for this .	0
Everything is great .	1
He made us his own craft cocktails and the food is phenomenal .	1
She was giving me attitude and rolling her eyes and on top of that while I was explaining this to my mom ( my mom only speaks spanish ) she 's talking crap about my mom and I to her co-worker right in front of me .	0
The entire staff was polite , helpful and made us feel at home .	1
The free-range chicken sandwich is delicious .	1
I had to laugh on the way out because I had been so so nervous and anxious .	1
I thought I would try them again and ask for less ice this time and the guy argued with me and said they ca n't do it .	0
It was so fabulous .	1
I totally recommend these donuts !	1
The maids have no regard for your schedule and even less regard for rooms with the `` Privacy Please '' sign .	0
3- In an unresolved effort I 've called the NV Net Metering Billing department three times everyday since I received my first bill seeking a clarification , 15 times I was left on hold and after 20 minutes each time .	0
The complex is very nice , well maintained and the location is very convenient .	0
She rushed thru my appointment and I had to ask her to fix the nail she repaired ( which by the way is already coming away from the nail ) , the paint was lumpy and uneven .	0
The pancakes ( smores ) were dry and unremarkable .	0
Poor customer service all around , especially from the higher-ups .	0
Not the first time they tried to screw me .	0
I will never come here again .	0
The skinny mArgarita was fantastic !	1
I will admit I was thrown off by the oranges at first , But The sauce was heavenly , and the whole dish just worked amazingly well .	1
Nice spot !	1
Really love this place .	1
The owner , Shauna , is super sweet and energetic and really makes everyone feel at home in her space .	1
They have great prices and really good drinks , so sad we are not from here and will not be coming back for some time .	1
Crooks !	0
- Plenty of Parking - Free Wifi that does n't require a password ( also unlike most wifi hotspots you do n't need to buy something to sit here ) .	1
But obviously , a 12 year old has no ID ( which the person trying to help us actually asked for ) , and they had her only listed as the authorized person A guy came to help then took my ID and disappeared .	0
After I am paying them for their service almost throwing away $ 1000 .	0
I always order chicken shish kabob while my boyfriend likes to try different dishes every time .	1
Simple but well executed .	1
Terrible service .	0
All prior dinners ranged from superb ....	0
I was in pain and that 's why I rushed here and left work early because they charge 25 if your late but they are ok with leaving patients to wait over an hour with no assistance .	0
We had the meatloaf dinner which was very inexpensive , but so tasty .	1
So all in all we left we will not be back as there 's another Brewery down the street from you now that has full service inside and out .	0
Chocolate pasteries are delicious .	1
This place stinks .	0
Waited 20 minutes to get a beer at the bar .	0
And it was very enjoyable .	1
She quickly fixed it but forgot to cancel the wrong pizza order on the bill and charged us for 2 pizzas when we had 1 pizza so we had to talk to her again to fix the mix up .	1
The paperwork from the Humane Society was never input into their system , so they had no record of her vaccination status , yet NEVER EVEN ASKED .	0
When I simply asked if they have coconut water so I could mix it with an island drink on the menu , the bartender rolled his eyes and told me no with an attitude , like I 'd asked the dumbest question requesting a drink at a bar .	0
ive only tried their steak & eggs but boy are they yummy !	1
Simply a marvelous dish .	1
Still slow service and poor communication .	1
I LOVE THIS CHILIS .	1
The kicker is that it truly IS divine and you will NOT be disappointed .	1
This place just lost my business .	0
I have tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt and have gone here a couple times since it 's close to me but after my last experience I will never go again !	0
I told her we requested her , and she was told by the hostess that she was requested , but failed to realize she was working .	1
They also do wedding cupcakes ! !	1

Everyone was so friendly and attentive .	1
It really makes me wonder why so many people were waiting in line , yuck !	0
5 stars ! !	1
My dog came walking , just vomiting , and pee infection .	0

Very much like the other locations well laid out with a nice selection of craft beers .	1
Terrible .	0
Quick and delicious .	1
Both of them were lukewarm .	0
And if you want an excellent cut , ask for Jodel .	1
not overly salty the broth is pretty clean .	1
I definitely could n't have had such a wonderful labor and delivery experience without Michelle 's support and guidance .	1
The experience is easy and simple : go in the shop and pick your cake flavor from lots of yummy options including chocolate , vanilla , coconut , strawberry , lemon , red velvet and more .	1
Biscotti are also very good .	1
Justin showed up early , knocked out tuning up all three of my furnances in record time !	1
So glad to find this place !	1
Norm 's is an incredible chef .	1
Make sure you see Lindsey N !	1
And of course the steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked .	1
I would rate this office a zero if I could .	0
It was amazing !	1
Many interactive activities for the children .	1
When we called him our pool was so gross .	1
I highly recommend ordering the Rad Na noodles or the spicy basil fried rice .	1
The Loyalty representative called me a liar , they have no record of an agreement , I have only been with Cox for two months ( since 9/20 ) , my rate should be $ 275 so $ 160 is a great deal and I should be grateful .	0
Marissa who sometimes checks people in can be very rude and very unprofessional .	0
I was so surprised today how soo tasty it was .	1
Service sucks , it took 25 min to get a beer only .	0
The Buffet was pretty amazing for $ 20 , and the rooms were super clean and quite .	1

But their food is the BOMB .	1
Best pre-game happy hours around .	1
Looking for an excellent service experience for your BMW ?	1

Belated in writing this review , but Nectar came through on delivery with a brilliant bouquet despite treacherous , post-snowstorm conditions on Valentine 's Day .	1
The shop was clean and smelled like pizza from pizzeria next door ... mmmmm	1
This is our favorite place for Mexican in Las Vegas !	1
The Mac was so runny and that same manager lied again `` it 's a new macaroni '' .	0
We were greeted with smiles and great energy .	0
It was surprisingly tasty !	1
Decided to try to go to the pool where they were turning away guests left and right for some of the most ridiculous reasons like wearing jeans making for very angry guests .	0
They have the best gym on the strip ( my husband swears ) .	1
The sandwich was very salty and was hard to eat ( because of it 's shape ) , the coffee tasted watered down as well .	0
Today I was n't even acknowledged when I sat at the bar for quite some time .	0
This is a good pizza spot .	1
Great job , once again , Daryl !	1

Here 's where it gets downright bizarre .	0
The fried rice was mushy .	0
They have the best chips and salsa EVER l highly recommend the seafood enchiladas and finish it off with deep fried ice cream for dessert YUM	1
SO GOOD !	1
Worst 14 $ I 've spent !	0
It never fails , every single time I come to this store most of the people who work there are always very rude .	0
There service is great , and it is family run which makes it even better .	1
I ordered the mushroom pizza and for something that cost $ 18 , I was totally underwhelmed .	0
At this point the waitress lost her cool and my friend just took the burger , we were finished eating at this point .	0
The bathroom was missing soap and the toilet was not flushing .	0
I used the cafe to get my caffeine fix while doing some work the past week and absolutely enjoyed it .	1
Also , love that they had a bunch of vegan options ! ! !	1
Had a very disappointing dinner here Saturday night .	0
FABULOUS ! ! ! ! !	1
Only real issue we had was a group of people who were talking about a political PAC which was extremely annoying and ruined the atmosphere .	1
I will NEVER stay here again .	0
The pork dishes were especially outstanding .	1
and sooooooo freakin tasty !	1
Chicken is very well cooked , good biscuit too !	1
They need to take down that `` All Day Breakfast '' huge misleading sign .	0
I feel I was swindled out of my money by paying for ineffective services .	0
Overall I have n't had a bad experience yet .	1
Pricing : 5 Stars - Great prices for the size of the portions and the quality ingredients and overall flavor .	1
We will be back , and with more friends , we 're ready to vouch for this place when we are looking for a great place to hang out .	1
Thanks so much !	1
The burgers were left out way too long and the fries were n't even cooked all the way .	0
Plus , the bar has great local beers on tap for while you wait .	1
The salads were my favourite part - 2/3 of them were delicious - the tahini and the labneh .	0
They told my agent the house was ready ... has been almost a week and still , have not even attempted to fix these issues , but I get ignored and excuses .	0
The staff at the visitor center is very nice and very helpful .	1
I love going to Edison 's !	1
I 'm not usually big on sweets , but I ca n't say no to these deep fried desserts whenever I 'm there .	1
The service there is excellent and they are always busy still making sure each table is taken care of .	1
Long story short my Dr was arrogant , did n't listen , and basically unprofessional .	0
I had only 4 choices in red wine , which I thought was exceptionally poor .	0
The atomsphere is nice , and staff are very friendly .	1
Also , the birthday donuts were really good !	1
The orange soy chicken is a must !	1
We asked for boneless and got bone in- it should of been a simple fix not a confrontation .	0
My husband and I went this evening .... LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
SCAM .	1
How many times have I waited at this doctor having arrived on time and waited 20 , 30 , 40 minutes ?	0
First when I was in the drive thru I was n't quite ready then I said I was did n't get a response back for about 2 mins .	0
I tried it and most of the drinks are horrible .	1
Congratulations Petco , you just lost two loyal customers .	0
Joy !	0
My daughter kids meal was probably the best but still not hot , this place ca n't get out hot and fresh if I could do 0 starts I would , this place needs new management and a new chef	0
For $ 25 on the weekend ( per person to do one of the escape rooms ) this is a great deal !	1
It 's true that they 're a better alternative than Waste Management , but this guy seriously needs some lessons on how to speak to his paying customers .	0
They go out of their way to deliver prompt and thoughtful care even in the midst of the many challenges and regulatory burdens that healthcare providers are faced with .	1
So , here 's the download : I asked for dusted cajun wings and while it looked large , the wings were lite in flavor leaning towards bland .	0
What a well-designed & delicious buffet !	1
I will never ever ever go back to recommend that anyone shop here .	0
Sad that they let someone with no customer service experience open up a smoke shop .	0
The food was really quite good with solid sized portions and great , informative , friendly staff .	1
Service is awesome , outdoor seating is perfect this time of year .	1
I gestured the waitress over , pointed to the four glasses of wine by the glass listed on the receipt and simply told her `` Mam , we did not order four glasses of wine , we ordered a bottle of wine .	0
It has large windows so its works well and gives you a wonderful feel while you eat .	1
It took them over an hour to deliver it and when it finally arrived it was cold .	0
Great food a little expensive for breakfast and they need more seating with the demand .	1
I 've had dinners here as well , and the fresh pasta is great , but my 4 stars here is for the brunch .	1
It 's got the coolest toilet in Calgary ( seriously it 's got a heated seat mode .. lol ) but I digress back to the hair , I 've never been unhappy with my cut there , Shaliza does a fantastic job .	0
They promise to call back as soon as they have an answer but never , ever called back .	0
When I got it , there was no seasoning at all .	0
I mentioned it was my first time here and the bartender did n't even recommend anything .	0
This is one of the worst businesses I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with .	0
I was petrified about going to the dentist but my coworker recommended dr. Schwartz and his staff and I 've never been happier ! !	1
The food is prepared fresh .	1
We 've watched the server get super irked when people seat themselves when the sign says to go for it , and then managers chase after people when no hostess is in sight so people start to wander ( no sign posted , but no person either ) .	1
There were so few people in the restaurant when we arrived yet the bartender/order-taker still managed to be dismissive toward us .	0
Last August I had my mower serviced including a broken blade replaced and the service was equally `` top notch ! ''	1

It has great food and the staff was friendly .	1
I begrudgingly tipped 15 % , the minimum .	0
I became annoyed at this point as my reservation was already paid for so I asked a clerk who was n't busy to see what the hell was going on but she just gave me a blank stare .	0
I requested a table for 2 and the blond RUDELY informed me that they did n't sit incomplete parties .	0

It has a great crunch to it and filled with flavorful crab meat .	1
Very disappointed and will not be returning .	0
Would not go to go it again very bored had no story line which made no sense at all .	0
There are so many dishes on the menu that I love , but I always come back to the chicken curry or chicken vendaloo .	1
So there it is worst customer service , Birthday age on the cake was incorrect and it tasted horrible as it was n't even the correct flavour ! !	0

Delicious !	1
Thank you guys so much Someone give these two guys a raise ! !	1
Got an awesome deal through them and had an awesome experience all around .	1
Sometimes slow , no personality and once we waited over 10 minutes for someone to even say hello .	1

The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly .	1
Meanwhile the $ 20 I spent on chicken has gone to waste and it will have been sitting there an hour .	0
The avocado toast was also to die for .	1
Check splitting is really easy , they do it for you automatically .	0
I just told him my baby is sick at home .. WTH ? ?	0
Ahh , Carson Street Deli , the crown jewel of Pittsburgh 's Southside .	1
This is one of THE WORST Wendy 's I 've ever encountered .	0
The first person in the ordering line with a green shirt whose name tag I caught said Taryn , was showing absolute poor professionalism to one of her co-workers in a black shirt whose name I did n't catch .	0
The salad had way too much dressing and did n't taste good.The minestrone soup tasted like it was from a can and was not hot .	0
You will be utterly disappointed .	0
As soon as I opened the door , I knew we hit a gem .	1
There was no-one else there so I 'm pretty sure he was trying to rip me off .	0

I am not downing the drink , I guess I just did not like the earthiness that it has , so I 'll not be ordering Absinthe again , but I had to try it at least once in my life .	1
Monday 's are wing specials ... Wednesday is Family bingo ... Thursdays are cornhole tournaments , Friday 's Karaoke .	1
and the brisket was sliced thinly and was very tender .	1
I was really hoping that the service was just a one time thing but after 4 times of the same lady I will just go to Starbucks where I at least get my coffee with a smile and no attitude .	0
Troy also went above and beyond by calling a ceiling fan manufacturer for us to try to troubleshoot an issue we were having with one of our bedroom fans .	1
My only one-star-off gripe is that they used to be open 24 hours , and I 'm a night owl who really enjoyed that , but they recently started closing at 1am .	1
My memory of this restaurant was a very busy yet enthusiastic owner who was happy to serve around their grand opening .	1
We will not be back .	0
Even with the fantastic location , look of the place , and what 's on the menu ( in theory ) , it was very disappointing .	0
They did not skimp on the seafood , with chunks of lobster , scallop and shrimp .	1

I was n't expecting much in the way of food , but I was pleasantly surprised .	1

This was a bad start but it was n't until they were done that I realized just how bad .	0
I am very disappointed .	0
He and everyone in the shop was nice and it was definitely a more mellow vibe today than it was the first time .	1
The food was disgusting and drinks were weak and pricy .	0

The presentation was awful .	0
2 stars : Poor food , poor experience , extraordinary measures in order for me to come back .	1
I go to Suzanne Mihocko for my facials and she does an excellent job .	1
Whatever your choice , they make sure it 's cooked to your liking .	1
I love it here , but there are two things I miss almost as much as family .	1
After 20 minutes we finally saw our waitress again ... her reply `` I 'm sorry I have n't been over to check on you , but the other waiter just walked out . ''	0
After you said you `` forgot to tell us some of the samples you showed us cost more '' that 's when he saw you did n't care and so yes he was rude .	0
I had the Big Island Style Mochiko Chicken bowl .... it was tasty !	1

That is a must have !	1
Do yourself a favor go elsewhere ! ! !	0
Thank you Christy , you saved my life ...	1
This is a quaint historic hotel that has been a part of Charlotte since 1929 .	1
I have been a regular client for over two years now and I highly recommend Jena as your personal Esthetician for many reasons .	1
Our waiter suggested a fabulous wine and was super friendly .	1
All entrees were terrific - the steak is some of the best I have ever had .	1
We bought a ton of stuff !	1
Was not afraid to be assertive to tourists so we could get some good shots and he was polite to people walking through the shot .	1
I have emailed them 3x without a response .	0
If you get it to-go they usually skimp on the hot sauce , but now I just ask for the number of hot sauce containers we want and it 's no problem .	1
The chicken and steak are fantastic , but we love everything there !	1
I asked for a napkin and she referred me back to my tray that she DID NOT put napkins on .	0
Slickables is glorious .	1
They also have a Buffett and Oyster Bar .	1
The Dr. Pepperoni one was amazing ! !	1
But service was friendly !	1
Xoxo	1
But mostly the service is what sucks .	0
Anyway , after standing at the bar for over 15 minutes trying to get the attention of one of the two bartenders or any of the waitresses walking by , we could n't get any service , not even a drink .	0
For a place that claims to be a `` taste worth dying for , '' should n't the burger actually taste at least mediocre ?	0
I ordered a bear claw and got adventurous to try the chai with almond coconut milk .	1
She really did n't want to visit the properties , even if I begged , just seemed like she only wanted to collect the rent .	0
They have a crazy selection of craft brews ( 50 some on tap , and another 100 bottled ) , and there 's always a tap that 's on special for really cheap .	1
This place is full of junkies and thieves , the apartments here at a very low level .	0
It is a lot of money to pay when I will not be able to use the unlimited membership to it 's full potential as I explained to the clerk but was basically told I was out of luck .	0
`` Overpriced '' as in : if the food does not taste good , I paid too much .	0
Again , I demanded that `` Zana '' call a Supervisor immediately , and she smirked and said , `` Too bad , there is n't anyone down here and you have to go upstairs to the counter and talk to a supervisor . ''	0
Jarrod 's Coffee/Tea Gallery is GORGEOUS and their coffee is also super yummy and reasonably priced !	1
This place is awful !	0
- Cycle around the reservoir - Hike the trails along the Elbow River and within Weaselhead - Canoe the reservoir from the Canoe Club ( when the water is really high , you can actually canoe down some foot trails in Weaselhead - I 've done it ) .	1
Horrible customer service ...	0
After waiting for over 20 minutes in the drive-through , the manager looked at us and said `` you have a blank stare on your face , can I help you with something '' ... that 'll earn you business tell em .	0
I attempted to converse with them thru Living Social merchant services and all they did was rant and accept no responsibility for anything .	0
The only reason I am not giving 1 star is that I believe the food would have been good had we gotten it in a timely fashion .	0
Thanks for canceling on us today and leaving us high and dry .	0
As for the food , I was not as crazy about the ham croissant as I was on the scones , but both are quite good .	1
Started with a tangerine mimosa to drink , which was highly recommended on Yelp .	1
There is constant turn over of management , with NO communication or documentation from one manager to the next so there is no written record of agreements made between managers and tenants and the tenants pays the price for this horrible and unprofessional mismanagement .	0
They infuse the gelato mixture with whole espresso beans overnight .	1
They were all pretty flavourful and spicy as we requested ( if you ca n't handle spice , ask for it to be mild ) .	1
When I got there some spaced out sales douche asked what he could `` help '' me with ( I forgot his name otherwise I 'd use it ) , I told him that I was picking up a phone that I ordered online .	0
I 've attached a picture to show what a dump this place is .	0
The manager is extremely rude .	0
threw it away too .	0
Visiting from San Diego and Amanda Morgenstern was the best waitress ever ! ! ! !	1
I thought everybody was kind in Scottsdale , and everybody was polite apparently this franchise or this chain just brings out the worst in their employees .	0
Made me feel really comfortable with my puchases and gave me their honest opinion on what looked better on me .	1
Aside from the obvious choice of fried chicken and waffles , the buffalo cauliflower was a clear standout .	1

When you find a place that has both a great atmosphere and terrific food , you 've got a winner .	1

It was amazing !	1
I did n't partake in any sushi b/c it looked suspiciously old and rotting sitting there for who knows how long .	0

And , IMO , the best dessert is the trio of salty caramel , banana toffee , and actual mint mint chocolate chip ice creams .	1
I would have given it 5 stars based on our first visit .	1
Instead she cut more like 3 inches off and gave me a scoop , not a V. I would only recommend coming here if you want them to jack up your hair .	0
This place sucks , I would never go back .	0
We had 2 appetizers : deer tataki and octopus stew .	1

This store is always clean , the staff is very customer service oriented , and well trained .	1
I will not step foot in that store again .	0

After waiting over 15 minutes to be helped by one of the two working tellers , I asked him if he could ensure it would be post marked for the date I brought it in .	0
The male counter person/owner unfriendly .	0
So , the food is definitely 5 star , the atmosphere is quaint and cozy , the wine selection is nice and the prices are definitely in-line with what you get for the money .	1
This place is usually very mediocre , besides the ghetto and trashy clientele , employee wise too .. lazy .. they do n't clean ... they do n't replenish food in timely manner .	0
Now , the concept of this place is cool and needed on this side of town .	0
They were dry and tasted peppery with zero flavour .	0

It tasted bland ( I 've never had this before ) and the lobster tasted undercooked .	1
Also sometimes I 've ordered the sandwich and sometime the fries that came on the sandwich were heavy on the salt , but with the coleslaw it usually evens out the salt ratio so still really good .	1

My favorite meats were Kobe , liver and the skirt steak .	1

It was a breeze from start to finish .	1
They helped my husband pick out cigars and the waitress helped me select a scotch , which I ended up highly enjoying .	1
Many munis are a joke , with poorly maintained greens , faster then Usain Bolt .	1

The partnership works excellently , with tasty food served with attentive and genuinely caring service .	1
Not impressed !	0

Very underwhelmed at this point I picked up the first one and that is when I realized that the chocolate sauce was not a garnish around the dessert to dip the smore into , it was now all over the bottom of the cookie and my thumb .	0
I guess they did n't make it because of how unorganized it was , my friend said the food was good but the service was a complete mess .	0
The service was excellent and based on the variety of different customers we saw enjoying their lunch Mt Everest India 's Cuisine is clearly a favorite and worth the short cab trip from any Vegas hotel .	1
They told us before we were taken back that if they can not help us then we will not be charged .	0
inside store and people are nice !	1
Apparently neither my tenant nor Gary bothered to actually test if the shower was still leaking - tenant took a shower a few hours later and water started coming out of the roof again .	0

My nail tech had no clue what she was doing .	0
The foie gras on one of my sushi rolls was a really nice touch .	1

Not flavorful at all- all the right ingredients , quantity and concept but seriously lacking flavor .	0
Staff - so welcoming and friendly - you 'll feel like you 've known them for years !	1
The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the enforcing of the rules by the teenage lifeguards at the lazy river .	1
After this last visit I wo n't return .	0
The other meal - was minus the steak he said it was too overcooked We asked for the check and forget the steak and then he brought out the steak which was still overdone and dry .	0
This place is absolutely beautiful .	1
Based on this experience I would never stay here again .	0
At the end of my meal , I paid + tipped the waiter , and then tried to give him some constructive criticism about how the food quality was poor compared to the prices .	0
Long story short some of the paperwork was submitted incorrectly and instead of giving me a hard time for something that was n't my fault she apologized and just fixed it !	1
Can never get ahold of them by phone , yet they claim to call regularly .	0
A steak frites for our son that was honestly fantastic with the shaved Parmesan on the fries and herb butter on the steak .	1

This place is known for its beer selection and I was not disappointed , great variety of local , regional , and national microbrews .	1
First my toe polish looked like it was painted by a 5 year old there was paint all on the side of my nails .	0
Coming from the customer service industry , that is unacceptable and wrong .	0
If a public entity or private business normally charges individuals for the damage they cause , an individual with a disability MAY BE CHARGED for damage caused by his or her service animal .	0
I am mad that ha had to give this place even 1 star .	0
They seem to really enjoy being there and share that happiness with every customer .	1
This place is horrid !	0

This place is completely disgusting & absolutely REEKS !	0

The broth was similar to the naengmyun one ( also with the delicious slushy broth ) , but there were two dollops of some kind of seasoned hot sauce on top of the noodles as well .	1
Their beef stew over rice with gravy looked fantastic , it 's on their $ 7.95 specials menu & comes with tons of tender beef , veggies & an egg and a double serving of white rice .	1
perfect for date night or dinner with the whole family .	1

The frosting tasted artificial and they were so bad we threw them out in the garbage ! !	0
This place was horrific .	0

Once we did get our food , my husband pizza was well done ( almost burnt ) and had been sitting and my pasta has sauce that was broken .	0
Food is excellent , staff does a great job and the restaurant is comfortable with both indoor and outdoor seating .	1
So the manager gets on and proceeds to tell me that she will not come on her day off to sit and wait nor will the dr pay someone to sit and wait .	0
So many authentic German dishes to choose from , it 's a wonder we were able to tear ourselves away .	1
Do n't even get me started on the wines or deserts , delicious !	1

Your attitude and your bad energy Mr. H. Gave this place 2 stars , and the two stars are for the view only , the rest was sour and left a bad taste in our mouths .	0
This by far IS THE WORST EXPERIENCE I have experienced in my life .	0
Unacceptable how we were treated .	0
Several of us opted for the salad and it seems the citrus vinaigrette was a good choice but a couple of us opted for the soup du jour which was seafood bisque which had several pieces of fish in it and was very tasty .	1

AMAZING restaurant for dinner .	1
She was wrong and `` allowed '' us to be seated without apology .	0
TL ; DR. Service was bad , food was atrocious ; do n't go .	0
Biggest plus is that this is a Pro store which means you can find colors and products not available in regular MAC stores .	1
Kim was awesome .	1
All of them should be fired for such horrible service and attitudes .	0
Trust me , go and reward yourself ... And be adventurous here , try a few new things .	1
I do n't know if it was just because they had n't been open for long and were still getting the hang of things , but my double chocolate cupcake was extremely dry and lacking all the flavor .	0
They will not clean the dust and spider webs out window , I guess this does n't fit the criteria of construction clean up .	0

Their wines were great and the prices quite reasonable .	1
I ask what the upcharge is and hear `` it depends on what you 're mailing and where it is going '' etc etc and by this time he 's being extremely rude and condescending .	0
I 'm very picky about getting my brows done - especially after having bad experiences elsewhere .	1
One of the employees was distraught and yelling profanities at what I can only assume was another manager .	0
Blond female employee at front desk is lazy as they come and has a bad attitude like she ca n't be bothered .	0
The wrap portions look humongous !	1
Also got a donut to-go and it was tasty .	1
I took my car in recently for a recall and they treated me very professionally .	1
Another front desk lady told me that they ca n't do that since they are n't a vet ( this is correct ) .	0
They are so flexible with scheduling , so understanding and always kind .	1
We came on a Saturday before any birthday parties took place so the workers took turns yelling OH just to see if we would holler back IO at them .	1
The staff here is horrible .	0
The small and family like atmosphere makes Sushi Maido a wonderful addition to the Annex !	1
Once the hostess got around to having us seated ( yes , she could n't be bothered to grab menus and take us there herself ) , we were left unattended for 17 minutes .	0
This is a nice place , huge humidor and an overall upscale vibe to it .	1
Absolutely horrible shopping experience .	0
I wanted to cover my pool pump , because it was an eyesore and the Las Vegas sun beating down on it was not going help either .	1
We are super happy we had start the day here , it gave us plenty of energy for the day and we definitely had to skip lunch .	1
Their food- although not the BEST tip top quality- i think was pretty darn good .	1
The mangoes are fresh and its almost a whole mango that comes with it .	1
I will not be back , mark my words .	0
It takes so fresh and just perfect .	1
So I approached a staff member and was told to speak to someone else .	0
Call me crazy though , but I would hope places I go to eat would help me avoid getting food poisoning from their food .	0
It 's the perfect place to go !	1
We had the edamame ( perfect ) , the tempura ( very good ) , Kirin ( always delicious ) , a couple of spicy tuna selections , and the miso soup .	1
I especially loved the thick pretzel bread stick they served before the meal .	1
We will NEVER refer anyone to A1 and I am shocked to find good reviews on here about that shady company .	1
Very good place to eat .	1

The staff is incredibly friendly even as busy as they were .	1
The seafood was all completely unfresh , fishy , and slimy ( like bacterial death slimy ) .	0
This places lunch menu is Bullshit !	0
The meat was tender , bread was fresh , and there are these sweet , crunchy , marinaded carrots on it that are so good .	1
Nice work !	1
I am in FULL agreement with what everyone else is saying about the poor customer service from a few months ago .	1
The place was dirty , hard to believe that from all the people I saw in there `` working '' , no one could clean the dining area .	0

Hands down worst club experience of my life .	0

In short , your credit card statement and checkout summary page will not match .	0
Food menu is unique and looks super yummy !	1
The Pho that I ordered was satisfying enough to fill my tummy and that warm amazing feeling after gulping down hot soup was great and comforting after a night of drinking !	1

Next my Pandan Crepe was a disaster .	0
Lovely place for some amazing live jazz and drinks .	1

what I know is that the ginger catfish is superdelectable , and with the rice soaked in the sauce from the fish ... mmm ... so great !	1

Their valet is terrible when I pulled up I got out of the car and the valley gave me a ticket and then walked away for a few minutes meanwhile my car is running and the door open with no valet near it .	0
Disappointing to say the least that they did not even contact me for follow up .	0
This is the only meal in my life where I can not wait to go back again .	1
They also had purse-hooks ( all high tables should have these ) in the form of carabiners that clip onto your purse strap - awesome !	1
Not the best Wendy 's , wo n't be back .	0
I can obly speak for Phil and Tiffany but they they were conversational , nice and take pride in their work .	1

Stay away !	0
My daughter loved it !	1
We love this place .	1
Poor service and aggressive pricing .	0
It feels like a regular neighborhood brewery .	1

You will not get far in customer service trying to insult someone 's intelligence .	0
Their ability to keep the dinning room clean surpasses my expectations for a Chinese buffet .	1
Terrible customer service and it was my birthday .	0
With all the hype over the cheesecake factory and with it finally dying down .. after waiting for an hour .. well meh tuna poke .. was basically a bowl of rice of flavourless rice and wasnt worth the price .	0
She was convinced that she was way more busy than she really was , and it translated to poor , bordering on rude service .	0
I was skeptical to visit this shop after so many mixed reviews , but I 'm glad I did .	1
Unfortunately she neglected to ask us the degree of spicyness we desired , so it needed help .	1

Tried and true sandwich is the Carly Q. Roast beef on an onion roll with the best BBQ sauce .	1

This restaurant has a beautiful , classic decor with clean lines and a sophisticated colour scheme .	1
I ca n't wait to try everything else on the menu .	1
They have a huge selection of plants and trees , frequently plants you ca n't find at the big box stores such as the braided trunk hibiscus .	1

My oldest daughter loves crabmeat cheese wontons so that usually winds up somewhere in the order : ) If we do n't order any dim sum or sushi , then we order Black Pepper Steak , my personal favourite Chinese dish and a shrimp dish such as Garlic Shrimp .	1
It 's become a tradition of mine to replace this annually , not because the need due to my overuse and rough handling of a truly quality product , but more because of the highly pleasurable and rare experience of interacting with professional sales representatives .	1
The dressing had a nice kick .	1
This was probably was n't the worst experience I 've had here but I was n't the best , they did n't know how to make a Texas marg .	0

Ordered 12 tenders here and was charged over $ 26 .	0
The hours are actually inconsistent , and they do not have a business line which makes things very frustrating .	0
Place is perfect .	1
Now it seems this restaurant does n't have good food safety practices .	0
DO NOT EAT HERE .	0

Not only did we get sexually and verbally harassed , but we were then made to feel unsafe .	0
I do not understand why the two other reviews I see on here are so poor .	1
All orders came perfectly cooked and served in a comfortable environment .	1

Obviously a great beer selection but very good food .	1
I look forward to returning in the warm weather months so I can stroll down Detroit Rd on a hot day enjoying another one of their many flavors .	1

I was getting full , but it sure did not stop me from savoring every morsel and making sure none of my Sunny was left behind .	1
That was so embarraSsing !	0
But their Saturday doctor did n't bother telling me that my blood test required I fast for 6 hours .	0
on the window beside us ; instead , we remained and were studiously ignored by the waiter and served food that was so-so at best .	0
The curry is really good , but the all-you-can-eat special is the best !	1
When your elevator smells vaguely of sewage for one afternoon , maybe it 's a bad coincidence with smelly food or some frequent farters who are staying there on the same night .	0
Greeted by a warm smile upon arrival and then had the pleasure of Amy working to rehydrate my skin .	1

It really made me fall in love with the city even more !	1
The volunteer workers were so sweet and caring for me popping in asking if they could give me anything to keep me entertained and it was much appreciated .	1
yummy .	1
Our favorite dishes are their salad and super grinder .	1
He said nothing else , so I canceled my order .	0
However , I will not go back to them again and would not recommend them or their services to others .	0
The seafood pasta was astringent tasting , and the chicken was bland and lifeless .	0
At that point another customer looked at me and said , `` It 's not worth it .	0
HOWEVER , the basis for my negative review is as follows : One night I was in Home Depot to pick up some lava rocks for landscaping use .	0
Excellent steak ! !	1
If you 've had Halal Guys off the streets of NYC then we 'll you 've already been exposed to this heavenly flavor ! ! !	1

There 's no assigned parking spots but apparently this guy thinks he 's the parking police .	0
The food was sub-par .	0
Vintage was more than fair and their service is excellent .	1
In my years of trying over 100 versions of lumpia , the best ones are homemade , not frozen already made .	1
Associates are rude .	0
Maybe to prevent a lawsuit against someone burning their tongue eating popcorn that is too hot .	1
They also lied to me that the sauces I repeatedly asked for were going to be in the bag .	0
It 's an insult to people 's intelligence , like we ca n't see through this attempt to rip patients off ! !	0
The others sound really good as we 'll but have not ventured out .	1
They should be ashamed and embarrassed .	0
Thanks to the excellent service I received from Mr. Olswski , I will continue getting my car serviced at this location and recommend it to my friends .	1

The dealer completely refused to offer an exchange even though we had just purchased the mattress a week earlier .	1
I would definitely recommend Dr. Wilson and his team !	1
I WILL be back : )	1
They have a nice little patio too !	1
The sauce was smooth and lusciously rich .	1
Great cocktails & apps !	1
My friend called to complain and the manager said that he would talk to the delivery driver and then told her to have a good night .	0
I gave him the feedback that they are not equipped to do prenatal massages , so they really should n't offer them at all , and asked for my money back ( I was crying the entire time , btw .	0
He said he thought we just wanted coffee , though we gave no indication for this and were very clearly looking at the menus ?	0
there 's nothing I can do about it because if you do n't pay the fee then we are losing money .	0
It 's dark and it 's smoky and they do n't have pool or darts but it 's a nice place to drink some beers watch the game and place some bets .	1

Fun ambience and authentic korean dishes .	1
All in all it was very good and I will try it again !	1
JW and I have been eager to find good japanese restaurants in the uptown area and we came across this hidden gem in Scarborough .	1
I 'm honestly only disappointed that I have n't already been here !	1
Indoors is a whole different vibe -- it 's a full house , you can see the other patrons around you .... but here , on the patio , we were in our own little world .	1
Wait staff is attentive and nice .	1
She 's my favorite eye doctor ever .	1
Everyone is friendly and kind .	1
Despite my excellent insurance , they OVERCHARGED ME EVERY TIME and when I questioned them , they insisted they do n't honor global billing and charged me for procedures they never performed which is INSURANCE FRAUD !	0
The iced dirty chai was really refreshing on a hot day like today .	1

; )	1
However , once we got to the host stand there was confusion and we were quickly handed off to a server who grabbed two menus , a kids menu ( we do n't have kids ) and began to run away without asking us to follow her .	0
When we got our lanes and bowling shoes the gentleman at the front was super rude .	0

The store was very well stocked and had plenty of varieties of herbal medicine for whatever ails you .	1

Other than that , great food , great wine , great service .	1
No concern for the customer , giving service , or common courtesy .	0

Super tasty .	1
Everything I have ordered from the menu has been absolutely delicious .	1
Could be worse .	1

Also a great place to go for a good beer as they have a very large craft beer selection with lots of local and seasonal brews .	1
Looking at others ' ratings of this place , I ca n't help but think my experience here has been an anomaly ; however , it is after my third unsatisfactory visit to the store that I feel compelled to write a review .	0
The skin of the dumplings was too thick and hard and the stuffing was too dry and bland .	0
The floor did n't get vacuumed for three days , and the silverware had n't been replaced .	0

Waitress never came back to check on us .	0
I greatly enjoyed my meal experience here .	1
So my main grips were seasoning ( fixable my anyone at the table ) , overcooked burgers ( training through experience rectification ) , and only 1 star reduction for what I dub wing wrong ( say that 5x fast ) .	1
The meat sauce itself was alright and did have some flavour but the gnocchi was actually inedible .	0
Barb , I 've had 22 Cadillac 's , this by far was the worst customer service I 've ever experienced ....	1

As such , Tony 's idea of customer service is to be dismissive , irritable , and to walk away rather than work collaboratively to resolve a customer 's complaints and grievances .	0
All I can say is beware of this company on the exit of your agreement .	0
The only minor gripe I have is the area to sit down and eat in .	1

Our food was served Luke warm at best .	0
I asked for a manager .	0

I have to admit , I think I subconsciously avoided this place because I find the name deeply unappetizing .	1
This was my first time trying southern sweet ice tea , which is supposedly also very good and a must-try .	1

Our guide was fantastic !	1
But then I said fine just charge the 25 dollars to my account if having that 25 $ fee is more important to you than keeping a repeat customer that has spent nearly $ 300 ( and was going to spend more on maintaience packages ) .	0

Waiting close to 2 hours is unacceptable for patient care , management needs to reconsider the protocol or this location will be losing business quickly .	0

Severely disappointed .	0
The back staff and the PA on staff were incredibly nice and professional but the lady at the front desk was cold and rude .	0

We live in southern highlands , but this was well worth the trek , and we will do it again !	1
Do n't bother ordering a second round of drinks , the unacceptable wait time means you 'll be sitting around waiting long after you 've finished your food .	0
Each time the hostess told the manager , who obviously did nothing because an hour later I had no soap .	0
I would definitely go again .	1
Our server then took over 30 minutes again just to bring us split checks and to process them , and never apologized for the mistake she admitted to making .	0

I absolutely did not order grilled cheeses but instead of apologizing and stating it was a misunderstanding he was rude and arrogant telling me what I ordered .	0
After two weeks within ordering , I still did not receive an email of confirmation or shipment .	0
Do n't be turned away by the prices , because the food here is WORTH it .	1
Never got around to posting a review until now .... Hope this prevents someone the headache of dealing with this awful place .	0
Will not be returning	0
The room itself was in the expected condition ... now that I 'm thinking about it the phone did n't work , there was no TV remote and the toilet 's flushing mechanism broke three times and I had to open the back lid to fix it. , .	0
Well , I was lied to ( since January ) , we are not enrolled .	0
They even had a small kid play area which was so nice !	1
I 'm starting to think this is one of those jag restaurants that purposely has really , really , REALLY bad service .	0
Highly recommend .	1
I was happy to finally try this place and will be back soon !	1
The service here was very friendly , patient , and considerate when interacting with me .	1
Food was delicious and portions were generous .	1
He told me that reserving a car was not a guarantee that I would get a car , because lots of people never show up when they had reserved a car .	0

We waited 30 minutes for a table .	0
When the hummus came it was a total disappointment .	0

The next morning when I looked at their number again and realized they charged me twice for the Destination fee , I am not happy with this tactic .	0
But that 's the secret .	0
Great lunch buffet with a large selection of various entrees and a reasonable price .	1
16 '' war für eine Einzelperson allerdings zu viel , 12 '' hätten gereicht : - )	1
The medical assistants have been worse .	0
Please bring some FRESH made entree 's into the mix , for your own success !	0
After a few days of continuous phone messages with no return call and trying to contact them via email and their Facebook page , I contacted the deal site and got a website credit ( not a full refund , as too much time had elapsed ) .	0
I had the most delicious dinner tonight !	1
On top of that they scheduled someone over me so they canceled my appointment to fit someone else in .	0
You are very thorough and kind when you call .	1
Also , our trainer provided false medical information and really was insensitive to anyone with an injury .	0
They told me that they could have switched it over which makes absolutely no sense because there 's no way Apple would have allowed me to take my old phone out of the store in addition to the new one .	0
The duck itself I must say was delicious .	0
Do not go to this so called `` doctor . ''	0
I cruised in with the case and said , `` What 's the least expensive way to mail this without it being ruined on the way ? ''	1
No apologies for the the absurdity of their `` rules '' and no explanations either .	0
I particularly liked sitting in the front room with the booths , as it was a cozy little nook to do some laptop work while I ate .	1
This helped us get good situational awareness so did n't have to be anxious during our trip .	1
There 's just so many small touches that make this such a great restaurant .	1
This was the best golden corral that i have been to service is what earned the 5 stars	1

Affordable and great customer service !	1
I highly recommend her !	1
I had thought they would fit in perfectly with my successful business so I was disappointed in their customer service which is basically non-existent .	0
If I 'm ever in this food court agan and looking for a meal option , I 'd rather go to Big Smoke than try this overrated , soggy mess of a burrito again .	0
And tried to tell me my white hairs were n't there .	0
DB Chocolates hits the trifecta of chocolate making : smooth , delicious chocolate ; inventive flavor combinations ; and beautiful presentation .	1
Fried zucchinni is also probably the very best I have ever had and the fries ! awesome !	1
Server never did check back after food was served .	0
I say , `` The issue is not money but the way we were humiliated both then and the way you are handling this now .	0
Then says that someone probably deleted the order from their order screen .	0
I gave them a call and the person I spoke to on the phone was extremely personable and helpful , she asked about the move , what my schedule normally was during the week , and the type of service I was looking for .	1

As a management major , Bill 's behavior was unethical and unprofessional .	0

For my mom 's service , she went in for her massage and had to lay on the say sheets that my aunt had just used , could see the mascara marks on the sheets ... gross !	0

Gross ! ! !	1

Brought friends and the service was HORRIBLE .	0
I ordered two of these because they looked so delicious from the window .	1
The gist of the experience was he refused to inquire on an appliance that we knew Spencer 's could order and was nasty about it .	0

He gave a sample of some drops ( which I did n't have to buy now : D ) and explained what was going on with my left eye .	1
Met the owner who really takes pride in his food and his restaurant .	1
As an example the items that I purchased this morning had been made on the 30th ( I should have checked the date ) and instead of `` crispy '' were soggy .	0
These wings are by far the best I 've ever had .	1
And not just because I share my name with their most delicious cookie .	1

It is super soft so it adheres to the ice cream .	1
Every Friday night they have wonderful live music ( not too loud ) .	1
The fries are also really crisp and delicious .	1

Horrendous .	0
When you call & leave messages , no one returns your call .	0
When this behavior was brought to the attention of the dealer and the floor manager neither took any action as apparently this type of grossly uncivilized behavior is tolerated in this pseudo-casino .	0
However , they wasted my 2 hours waiting .	1
After waiting for about 15 minutes , I went to the bar and asked them if they could get her which they did not and I just paid my bill to the bartender , which was odd .	0

I will not be back , as the chicken is ok , but factor in a 30 minute wait , just is n't worth it ..	0
There are plenty of staff who are very eager to help .	1
This place is great !	1

Pool trash cans are rarely emptied and the grills usually stay broken .	0

He wo n't be back and my advice is listen to word of mouth referrals , do n't just look for groupons for stuff to do with your health .	0

To die for !	1
Both of their mild and spicy BBQ sauces are great .	1
Would not recommend this school .	0
Best ever !	1

Happy hour starts at 11pm , try their gyro sliders they are bomb !	1

He whipped it up quickly while I waited on a very comfortable couch .	1
I had a really negative experience a while back with Tony ( very rude and made me feel uncomfortable ) , so I went elsewhere for a while and decided to give it another try .	0
Food was good , not the best or the worst ceviche .	1
It explicitly says `` Cocktails '' in the Star on the first page of their website , yet when I visited the establishment , they would only serve me beer .	0
The employees have zero concept of customer service .	0
So I was frustrated by their lack of understanding their client 's needs , wants or choices which would make a dinner much better .	1
But not a single one of them seemed to have any idea what they were supposed to be doing so I guess they needed all 3 idiots .	0

Why would we pay for a service we intended on cancelling ?	0
In response : You should better educate your staff members , due to that is not what they told me and my husband when we visited your location today !	0
They finally sent the manager over after walking past our table several times , tittering about us like immature children ... only so she could tell us that she was the one who placed the bar order and to apologize for her incompetence .	0

Delish ! !	1
I really wish they had name tags so it could be clear who is offering horrible service , because the other girls were nice .	0

They also play Charlie Chapman films on the t.v Which is always a plus for me .	1
My eyebrows naturally have different shapes so I wanted them to perfectly match ( which she did ) I personally wanted a very natural look .	1

We had to ask for the wine menu and were never even served water .	0
They are also featured on a few food delivery apps and yelp delivery which is very convenient for a sushi night at home .	1
I 'm a fan of matcha which is prominent on their menu , so I will be back .	1
AMAZING !	1
NOTE TO ANITA : do n't put your name and phone number on the bottom of the swipe pads , telling customers to call you when they have difficulties accessing their storage units , if you really do n't intend to offer them any help .	0
I 've been here before when it was dirty but now it is amazingly filthy .	0

My to-go order was quick !	1
The steaks are phenomenal .	1

I went with Chana Masala which was a tad spicy and full of delicious flavors .	1
It was all excellent .	1
The risotto was undercooked , not creamy , mushrooms were rubbery , and only two small pieces of lobster in an extremely small portion that we thought was an appetizer delivered by mistake .	0
I have no idea what the third meat was in the dish but suffice it to say that , after trying to find any tender meat around the bone , I gave up as it turned out to be a useless effort .	0
You can eat this for a man by itself !	1
Enjoyed my experience here overall !	1
Food was fabulous ! ! !	1

My experience has been horrific with the people and company .	0

Reviewing the discharge papers : If I ask you a question , as a professional its your responsibly to answer my question , not treat me like I 'm some uneducated idiot for asking .	0
There is no benefit to giving your money up front .	0
We only saw our waiter twice , the first when he took our drink order and the last when he dropped off the check ... he never checked up on us , and every time we needed something we had to stop another server which was annoying .	1
This doctor truly is the best .	1
Food was ok for the price , service was slow and not very good	0
I had the worst experience I 've ever had at a nail salon at Crystal Nails .	0

It was definately worth the drive .	1
she was so pissed that i sent it back .	0
The meat have weird smell , employees very rude and disrespectful and they take forever for one sandwich .	0
The drinks are a bit on the pricey side for my tastes but if you 're looking for a good local brew , here is the place to go for that hometown Cleveland flavor .	1
overall , horrible customer service skills and quality of food .	0
And the owners wife , she 's always so rude !	0
The food comes out quickly and again , it 's a cheap fix so do n't expect anything mind blowing but you will get a quick , cheap and solid meal .	1

Love DD , but this morning 's experience at this location was awful .	0
Imagine eating a soggy piece of beef with no char at all or even having a meat take 5 minutes to even get to medium rare when it 's supposed to take 2 minutes or less .	0
! The front office staff woman Cindy does not like being told she is wrong .	0
When you got the munchies , midnight snack , after clubbing or whatever this is a major must !	1
We are constantly finding cockroaches and water bugs throughout the apartment and porch area .	0
So partly it was my fault for getting the worst haircut because I decided to stay .	0
Got the WORST haircut I 've ever had from a women named Susy .	0
And the chili was served barely warm .	0
No offer of any kind was made and when pushed , all she said was that she might give a $ 50 credit against the resort fee .	0
Second , not on the menu description , we also received sauteed potatoes , a lovely fresh fruit cup , a shot of guava juice , and a basket of fresh croissants .	1
Mmm mmm !	1
This `` company '' , their manager/owner , and their employees suck !	0
Cute and spunky place with delicious food !	1
Waitress was condescending and snooty .	0
The menu is massive , but you really ca n't go wrong with any choice .	1

Putting Cowboy in Cornelius NC is like putting China Garden in Naples , Italy .	1
I 've stayed at multiple hotels throughout various trips and this place has earned itself the worst hotel experience I 've ever had .	0
The introduction of internet TV has totally blown them away .	0

Also , an important note , even the bathrooms are clean .	1
Worst place ever .	0
Worst company in the world to do business with .	0
I sent them my email confirmation with the correct flight times that I had anticipated and they still said there was nothing they could do because it was n't a change of 4 hours .	0
There is a serious lack of decent food options that are quick at this terminal .	0
Many places forget the lemon and they are just bland but these are soooo very good .	1
Stephen is amazing !	1
The only positive thing is that they have not contacted me at all to try to keep negotiating .	0

Fantastic selection and so in love with the dress I picked .	1
When I did not receive my order by the 31st I sent an email and received no response , so I emailed again on November 5th .	0

The daily special was Buffalo Mac and Cheese ; my friend and I decided that it looked pretty tasty , plus it was on sale !	0
Not sure if they are understaffed , poorly managed ( or both ) .	0
Maybe he knew we were n't enthusiastic about the food and figured he would focus of other people ... either way it was annoying and rude .	0
I wo n't be returning unless their service improves and their food quality returns to what it was at their previous location .	0
This was a delay that they knew about but they failed to contact me about .	0

The pastas are made in house and are amazing .	1
And neither time did I even get so much as the common courtesy of them saying I was n't `` good enough '' to do business with .	0
I will never return and most certainly never buy a firearm here .	0
BEWARE ! ! !	0
Was it the best burger I 've ever had ?	1
Worst ever we had our 6 year old son with us and when we returned our car they said they were charging us $ 300 for smoking in the car .	0
The price is fair too !	1
I saw what people were eating around us and the pork cutlet dish looked delicious .	1
Pasta dishes are yummy .	1
Thank you to Chef Deidre for that !	1
Our server , a blonde haired woman with a red top and black spandex pants , on the other hand , made us feel awful .	0
Wonderful home cooking- fresh , with different flavours than the typical Indian or Middle Eastern foods we all have all the time .	1
What matters is that the selection of fish is huge and always unique ( no saltwater for those interested , however ) , and every animal seems healthy .	1
Love this place .	1
Be sure to stop by and enjoy this wonderful place .	1
Dear fellow yelpers , Thank you so much for recommending me to this dim-light snazzy place .	1
Gazing out the window was calming and relaxing .	1
The service was fast and accurate , and I do n't have a bad thing to say about it .	1
But product availability can be incredibly frustrating and inconsistent .	0
Do n't forget to take a ride on the roller coaster at night !	1
This place reminds of a more modern Baja Fresh which had great salsas , especially the chipotle .	1
Shortly after returning home my stomach began to rumble and within a couple of hours I was sick with what appeared to be food poisoning .	0
The store owner is horrible .	0
Super engaged .	1
I talked to a live , friendly person ; in fact , I called 3 times within an embarrassingly short period of time because of having so many questions - and every time , very friendly !	1
It was a very awkward greet , walked in and there was no life .	0
It can get muddy but what good is it if you do n't let your pup get a little dirty every now and then : ) .	1
The BBQ chicken and beef are both delicious .	1
We shared brisket and pulled port and it was heaven .	1
I also love the cocktails !	1
the quesadilla was way overpriced at 12 bucks , not good bang for your buck .	1
5 stars to the incredible staff that are somehow always so cool , calm , collected and helpful .	1
Both were extremely bland .	0
Have held a few large gatherings for family here and would n't go anywhere else .	1
Then they said they would give us our money back .	0
It is so unsafe .	0
Again getting in was a breeze .	1
It is really warming to have beautiful , smiling faces taking your order .	1
Enjoy !	1
Of course the owners going to post public comments saying my claim is unsubstantiated , do you really expect him to take ownership of their failure ?	0
Not sure about their other food on the menu but the sushi is not worth the money	0
He was really great at keeping the aisle clear for people to enter and leave the dance floor but was n't trying to be intimidating at all .	1
I became very disappointed with this location after a while .	0
This review may or may not help you in your decision to visit this location , but I 'm definitely never coming back here .	0
Great place !	1
Do n't be intimidated by all the stickers !	1
I had the worst experience from the time I walked through the door until I returned the car .	0
And do n't even get me started on their billing practices .	0
the ketchup is watery and disgusting and the boneless wings were either overcooked or just that nasty to much breading I would never come here again and everyone that ask me about this place I tell them the same thing	0
They have outdoor seating as well and cornhole for the drinker that likes to be active .	1
The food is so tasty .	1
Overall this is one of my favorite places to go in The District , and I go out of my way to come to this Hallmark and will continue to do so .	1
I told him the crew that picked it up did n't return them .	0
And if that was not ridiculous enough this cashier then went on to embarrass this poor older customer when the customer said there was no need to yell at her and YES the cashier was embarrassing her .	0
The ID was a valid Arizona state issued driver 's license .	0
Let 's start with when we walked in at 1:30 and 1/2 the tables in the main area were reserved , were told they could give us a table but we needed to be out by 3:30 .... ok no problem .	0
Pathetic Very .	0
There are just a few tables inside as most guests tend to take out , but there is also some outdoor seating .	1
Tony then proceeded to tell us it was because of all the `` add ons '' .	0
When Suzanna finally answered , I then asked to speak with her manager .	0
This company is unprofessional , unprepared and overcharges .	0
Sadly , false advertising got the best of me and they are CLOSED .	0
Everything was delicious ! !	1
They are amazing !	1
Absolutely the best pizza around & the cannolis are to die for .	1
I walked up to the Payless counter , ( no one in line , 2nd clue ) , and they said they would match my agreement with Fox .	0
Definitely avoid this place at all costs ! ! !	0
After 2 and a half hours it was finish and it was more than i could have imagined !	1
The merchandise is of high quality .. the t-shirts are so soft and good design .	1
Give her a try , you 'll be glad you did .	1
Tho they do take their time with your food , do n't be fooled , it 's horrible and burnt and not what you expect , I promise .	0
Sent them back and they still came back uncooked .	0
Best pizza in town !	1
Along with the wall dividers and the sushi bar , bamboo plants are used to break out the room into smaller intimate dining areas .	1
So good !	1
I would recommend her work to anyone who was looking for lashes , permanent makeup , an eyebrow wax or anything else !	1
They refuse to answer your calls or call you back , even if you leave messages highlighting the importance of the situation .	0
I love this place .	1
The sandwich itself was bland , the cheese was not melted , and the meat itself was a grey , unappetizing color .	0
I was originally planning to go to a range much closer to my house but had a horrible experience trying to register with them .	1
He is extremely thorough and does amazing work .	1
I even asked my boyfriend to try some and he said `` I do n't even want to finish chewing it . ''	0
... my company allows more than 20 % tip so that not the problem it 's just the thought that she thinks she deserve that amount , for sub par rude service .	0
If I could , I would give ZERO stars ! !	0
Horrible management !	0
The did NOT apologize or anything .	0
Also the iced coffees we got were undrinkable they tasted so stale .	0
: ) recommend to anyone looking for some fresh healthy eats !	1
Their prices were also very respectable , and I 'll be using them again in the future for my home wiring needs .	1
Super happy I started coming here .	1
The bartenders are really awesome and they have a huge selection of beer and cocktails to choose from .	1
There is zero accountability and complete dishonesty with this airline .	0
This course should be embarrassed to charge a greens fee given what pitiful shape their greens are in .	0
Great menu and my server is professional , friendly , prompt .	1
Congrats on your overall 2 stars on Yelp .	0
I am giving it a 4 star mostly for their tacos and guac !	1
Still no eye contact , greeting or acknowledgement of any kind .	0

When confronted with this I was compensated a couple bags of shock .	0
* Overall extremely run down , smelly , and not a pleasant stay .	0
So my landlord called them first thing this morning again and they told her they 'd have someone call me right away to reschedule and they had no idea why the technician never showed up .	0
Check in line absolutely too long whenever we called downstairs the the front desk NO ONE ANSWERS !	0
Take out service is great as is the dine-in .	1
Everyone was extremely friendly and we will definitely be back !	1
Small and expensive but worth every bite .	1
They offer a unique spin on Indian cuisine , by combining it with traditional western dishes .	1
The show was very entertaining and my kids especially enjoyed it .	1
Might I add , the restaurant was gorgeous and the atmosphere would be perfect for any occasion .	1
Cozy little hole in the wall .	1
Will definitely be returning !	1
However , she messed up my orders and was very slow .	0
The meat seemed like pretty good quality , but they are so bland !	0
Very friendly staff with a fun `` hole in the wall '' type of feel .	1
Another 10 minutes later , she comes back to tell us that her food should be done soon .	0
Talk about false advertisement !	0
I can find it elsewhere & wo n't be back .	0
The biscuits were obviously home-made and absolutely light and fluffy .	1
It looked completely unappetizing .	0
The ribs were good but the brisket was fatty and full of gristle .	0
He was very personable , knowledgeable and professional .	1
The second issue was she asked for another credit card as the one I had `` on file '' was not working .	0
My favorite desert was the creme brûlée and churros .	1
Sat at a booth in the bar area and have to say Ashley who was also working the bar , making milkshakes , and dealing with call ins and pick up orders was amazing .	1
Food is good and exactly what you would expect from a traditional mexican restaurant .	1
She thought it seemed low but since she had already told Miss KIm to charge for both she did n't argue .	0
However , everything else about the place was pretty lack luster .	1
Aquarium is very well kept and all staff were friendly and welcoming .	1
Service was so horribly slow to get food or drinks .	0

DO NOT GO HERE .	0
After another 20 minutes , she conceded to give me a credit for 1 of the salads ( $ 12 ) and said she would do that immediately .	0
I then asked to speak with the store manager and was told , `` I am the one who the calls end with .	0
Overall , though , Wine Up was a pleasant surprise to find in the middle of Charlotte .	1

Everything on their menu is delicious and Stephano 's also offers a great catering menu ( I 've gotten catering from them for family dinners and by far one of the best deals in town ) .	1
The girl bussing our table was super slow , no sense of urgency whatsoever .	0
Highly responsive and easy to work with .	1
I have experienced first-hand the poor service at this restaurant and can fully support all the other negative comments about the service at this restaurant that have been posted .	0
If you have n't tried it you really must !	1

At this point , we were so dissatisfied with the service we quit asking .	0
I personally really liked the salad and the house Italian dressing , but it is very Rosemary based , which some may not like .	0
They were so condescending !	0
It 's her own private studio so she is flexible and willing to be available when you are .	1
Seriously ca n't be beat .	1

The sales reps for this company are SLY and DISHONEST .	0
Alexis is the bomb ! ! ! !	1
Yesterday evening I received an email stating that it would be the 26th or later and that you could not guarantee when I was recieving them .	0

My Husband & I were married here on 7/15/15 and it was such a great experience !	1
The decor is a bit over-the-top hippie tacky but it 's a small price to pay for kool-aid and tang on tap .	1
On top of that , you can order numerous variations of the french fries , as you can get a lot of different sauce/topping combinations like buffalo/blue cheese , bbq/ranch , sour cream/onion , and garlic aioli .	1
This must be how they make their money charging families that do n't attend .	0
They never followed up and I gave up feeling utterly hopeless like my concerns fell on deaf ears .	0
The best part is all the food is healthy and I thought it was gon na be expensive but it 's not : ) Will I be back soon ?	1

I called back immediately and got the office voicemail again .	0
It 's a simple concept , and good food !	1
I guess , maybe , I feel as though feeling `` full '' is n't so much about the portions as it is about how satisfying the meal is , and to me , this was a very satisfying meal .	1

The lady then said WHILE SITTING DOWN ON THE COUCH `` You know , most brides know after the 3rd dress they try on that that 's the dress they want . ''	0
It 's a dish that is intriguing all the way through and with each bite , you wonder how they accomplish so much with just angel hair pasta and if you could somehow figure it out and make something just half as good because that would be a success .	1
We would definitely recommend this company if you are looking for quality furniture and quality customer service !	1

The man really knows his business and I rank him up there with the best in the XLT program .	1
It is a very fast and efficient and always busy .	1
They are open later than other boba places I 've been to as well , so that 's always a plus .	1
Whats worse they are making me jump through hoops to get my money back while I still have to find another printer .	0
Cool ambiance too .	1
I wish doctor 's would realize how vital their staff is because a great doctor that operates like this is useless .	0
If I could give zero stars , I would .	0

If I could give this place no stars I would .	0
I was shocked and that was the last straw .	0

He was very patient and very good with communicating with us .	1
The employees could be a little more helpful , as everything here is foreign to me , but I can overlook that for what is offered and the homey decor .	1
Totally not worth it .	0
horrible , confisicate $ 200 with promise of exam to your pet .	0
Overall , really enjoyed the experience and will definitely go back the next time I 'm hit with a sheesha craving .	1

The chicken wings - stay away .	0
Yes , it 's a bit pricey for Charlotte , but it 's worth it .	1
Love love love this place ! !	1
I tried tipping him and he refused .	1
Then i asked for a refund which got ignored .... I think this is a scam so sad cause they have the potential to be great and honest and still be fine .	0
Guess what , they would n't accept it because I did n't have my government issued id .... drivers license ... with me .	0

Now keep in mind this place is way off the beaten path .	0

I had heard talk of a board game cafe opening up in Cleveland , and my boyfriend is an avid board gamer , so Thanksgiving break was the perfect opportunity to check out Tabletop Board Game Cafe with him .	1
He said `` Well it 's on now '' and walked away .	0
Does n't seem as if the managers / chefs have been reading any of these reviews , or they are simply ignoring them .	0
I understand that it is a high volume store , but it 's so dirty that I 'm ashamed that I even step foot in the store .	0
Horrible service .	0

Terrible !	0
and each of the restaurants had their own unique features which made it fun .	1
And my toilet is still broken .	0
We purchased our vehicle here , but will NEVER be back again .	0
The reason that I gave it 2 stars is because the steak was tender and the ambiance was ok , the service was just ok .	0
She gave me new silverware roll & never brought the check , ketchup , or checked back to see if everything ok. After waiting & waiting I got the asian waiter 's attention & asked if he could have them remove steak from the bill and bring it .	0

I live in the Dilworth area and this has become my go-to .	1
I was just in to get some food and as I sat down the two woman working behind the counter started arguing with each other .	0

Wo n't recommend this place !	0
The atmosphere of this place is best described as welcoming and relaxing .	1
This time I 'll have to give it one star I gave the waiter the benefit of the doubt .	0
WTF ?	0
This furniture has been diagnosed by the service department as normal wear and tear and if that is the case then Conn 's is ripping consumers off with overpriced cheap furniture that does not last the duration of the contract .	0
A lady greeted us with rude attitude and we tried to ask for a table with 4 seats as we have big hand carry .	0
Then again , anything you go with is pretty darn good .	1
Having seen this scam before , I figured I would take the single in my pocket and drop that in the slot .	0
Best in town !	1
Very chill atmosphere .	1
Sat upstairs where it was nice and cozy .	1
Bottom line , a greedy Franchisee ... BE CAREFUL if you are a Senior or parent .	0

Sandwich was undercooked , got a fried chicken which ended up having two wet chicken cutlets on it that tasted like they were sitting in water all day .	0

His dish was delicious and blew mine out of the water .	1
Two chefs started to fight in the kitchen , one of whom was cussing profusely and throwing F bombs multiple times to be heard by ALL customers including my 7 year old .	0
( I personally do n't like exercising ) Everyone here has come to be family and has helped me stick to my health goals this time around .	1
Dessert-wise , I love their take on Tiramisu ... especially the brittle part !	1
Absolutely wonderful !	1
I 'll bet Sam Fox is pissed they stole his concept ( `` mediocre { TYPE OF CUISINE } in a hip space '' ) .	0
The tortilla chips that come with the dip are hot and crispy -- probably a million calories , but who the heck cares when it tastes SO GOOD !	1
All in all its a MUST RECOMMEND !	1

The only negative is that I have lived in AZ for almost 3 years and this was my first time going !	1
Overall very nice place .	1
I even looked up for any other FOX restaurants that might be in California which I plan on visiting since I had such a great experience at this restaurant .	1

Rudest cashier ever , her name is Mary .	0
It was now 32 min and still nothing .	0
Gelato flavors are made in-house and they use fresh ingredients , which results in naturally and deliciously flavored gelato that is as good as it 's going to get in a desert ( aka : not in Italy ) .	1
The only bright spot was Darius who kept me informed and apologized for things not in his control .	0
terrible phone and customer service .	0

Will never go back or recommend to anyone .	0
Service was not terrible , but not award-winning ( only after answering a question about the quiches and then letting me choose which one I wanted did the guy behind the counter tell me that it would n't be heated , their microwave was broken .	0

I was here last Saturday night and was severely disappointed .	0
Service was easy-going and casual .	1
They are so fake and intentionally rude .	0
This is complete and total lack of respect for your patrons .	0

He worked with us and was great .	0
I wo n't be back here , and based on the lack of business I doubt it will last much longer .	0
Typically at a tapas restaurant , you would see Fideo prepared as Fiduea ( pan fried thin noodles ) , but this method of preparing the fideo noodles really made me feel like I was eating a typical family style meal in Spain !	1
We did and the cancellation policy states that if you do n't cancel by the time they say , you will be charged .	1
They are awful .	0
You can choose how spicy you 'd like it so , both my fiance and myself were very impressed .	1
Also , since this is the only game in town for movies , it is also a kid magnet so they can sometimes take away from the movie experience from time to time making noise during the film or playing on their phones .	1
The time before this ... which I should have learned my lesson .	0
Everything is super shiny and did n't have to wait too long for a table , but I can see this place being packed on the weekends .	1
We always sat on the outdoor patio with a great view of the Bellagio fountain .	1
We did not ask them to change anything , we repeatedly stated we just wanted information .	0
Delish fried pickles and tater tot apps though ! ! !	0
Worst customer service ever !	0
Staff was quite friendly and the establishment was so fresh and so clean .	1
She dismissed us by rudely saying `` I told you , he is in the showroom . ''	0
They only became aware of it after I asked why no one had called me about the results.This happened more than 2 weeks after the biopsy and so it was past the time when they should have contacted me .	0
BE AWARE : this place adds 20 % to your bill for a tip , does not return the original receipt but gives you a final receipt with only the full price and it has a spot for a tip again .	0
I told the manager that he had over charged me which then continued to argue with me .	0
I wish them great success !	1
The ambiance was so fun and relaxing .	1
This experience was the complete opposite of what we thought it would be , will definitely return here and most likely at 8am to be done super quickly .	1

My son is a picky eater too and he was also happy with his fajitas .	1
We got a guava mimosa and monkey bread on the house because our food took awhile to come out .	1
I do not recommend this place to anyone .	0
Service was terrible and food even worse .	0
The artichoke was by far the tipping point ... so overcooked and mushy in a weird brown no flavor sauce packed with flavorless bread crumbs topped with a stabbed lemon slice on top .... Never order this , it was just gross .	0
Not extremely cheap , but definitely on the very affordable side .	1
because they have the consent agreement , so if they make mistake and ruin your face , they dont'care , Dont go there for laser , they are NOT professional , knowledagable and responsible .	0
I will be going back for all my car care needs !	1
I 've been coming here for several months , amazing , clean place , professional staff and relaxing atmosphere .	1

I highly recommend the chemdry process as it is much drier than other carpet cleaners .	1

Thanks Carol ca n't wait to see you again : )	1
His favorite place to eat in Vegas is Ichiza , he is n't on Yelp ... Okay , I think that 's enough chef background for now ...	1
This church is like no other , God truly moves in this place !	1
The standouts for me were the Heavenly Hash and Cotton Candy Ice Cream flavours and the fresh fruits and marshmallows to dip in the chocolate fountain .	1
Sweet trolley was incredible , especially the lemon meringue .	1
Quibbles include the fact that people in Paris are n't afraid to season foods with salt ... and these escargots could have used a lot more of it !	1
They were n't apologetic just made excuses and lied .	0
The taco salads here are wonderful and so tasty , especially when I cover it with their homemade salsa .	1
Hope the scam is worth losing a customer for life .	0
We ordered a couple teas after the meal and it took nearly 45 minutes to receive because of some `` miscommunication . ''	0
The service was so so bad ..... if you are Vietnamese and you come there with kids , trust me ... they will not welcome you at all .	0
So sad to waste your time and money on a trip .	0
I go to Sarah and Lisa and they are both amazing !	1
They accurately estimated the delivery date , which is nice , but THREE WEEKS is a long time to wait for such a substandard product .	0
Meanwhile , I noticed the instructions show to screw the side legs into the hole .	0
If your a taco lover , you really should try to come here some time for some of the best tacos in Las Vegas .	1
Will recomend it to everyone who is visting Vegas .	1
Overall , it was a meh experience .	0
When our food finally arrived , it was all wrong .	0
I rarely give two starts to a place unless they really screw up .	0
Hopefully they will refund my money for the order i already paid for online .	0

Really nice service , timely food and knowledgable and friendly staff .	1
We all contacted the company a month after the purchase and we all received the same message , stating there was a mix up and the orders would be shipped out the very next day .	0
You can expect to wait for a table on a weekend morning , even just for two people , however the wait is worth it .	1
Tom called me back very quickly and was able to set up a same day install .	1
I will definitely come back here the next time I 'm in town .	1
They also give you lettuce leafs that you can wrap you meat in !	1
Absolute terrible experience , and I never even had services turned on .	0
I 've had good cupcakes before and considering the price these were not worth it .	0
My sister said it was the best cheesecake she 'd ever had .	1
I truly feel that this theatre is a gem !	1

We gave her a great tip even though she was unfriendly and not very accommodating .	1
And Vintner continues to impress as the wait staff offers their assortment of dinner rolls and oil/butter and the main waiter welcomes you by informing you of the specials of the evening .	1
It was so dry and tasted so awful that we asked to talk to the chef , who was very nice and apologetic .	0
I found this place through yelp when trying to find a new sandwich place around me .	1

It 's a shame that the workers were n't able to acknowledge the problems going on with the animals .	0
A simple oil change and requested air filter ( they did n't even check because dust was intact on the metal clips and screws not even touched ) took a little over an hour .	0
Carla Lampert the DPT there is AMAZING also the Massage Therapist Zac .	1
Each time the service and good was superb .	1
The fries were of the crinkle cut variety , but we 're so well-seasoned that they stood out .	1
My partner orders the strawberry milk every time and it tastes great as well .	1
But the service is far below par .	0
Fast forward over 45 minutes and 3 curbside phone calls later , I cancelled my order .	0
I 'm Canadian so do n't know much about any of them but there were tons to choose from and found the prices very reasonable .	1
Do n't let the outside appearance of this place tucked behind a hair salon fool you , they are serving a very good menu , service is always excellent and attentive , and the draft menu is a great combination of local draft beers .	1
Thanks Garrett !	1
Atmosphere is perfect , awesome happy hour from 3-7 7 days a week , and great food !	1
the combination of chinese/mexican works amazingly well .	1
I live all the way in Anthem but i will be coming here for all my automotive needs !	1
Let 's just say a driver acted very inappropriately and the management 's response was `` ohh we talked to him , he 's old so sometimes he forgets his place '' .	0
Thanks Randy !	1
Some nights are better than others , but in general , they book quality stand-up comics and I do prefer this location for their comedy over any other club in town .	1
The building/layout itself is very spacious and has that Southern American flair of roasted meats and hot , open parilla kitchens .	1
I asked to speak to the manager , who was just as rude .	0
Should have been $ 16 dollars - he proceeded to charge us $ 18+ for the Gyro and fries listed on the menu .	0
Plus with the friendliest staff ever , what more can I ask for ?	1
I asked for my money back and the response was offensive .	1
I love the waffles and the Valley of the Sun breakfast with chorizo black bean chili and eggs .	1
Bottega is an awesome choice and I 'm very glad to see that a legitimately local pizzeria is doing so well in this area .	1
Wo n't be back again , especially when there are so many other choices close by .	0
Never coming back !	0
We grabbed dinner here before Magic Mike and it was perfect !	1
The only bad thing was that we could n't get everything on the menu .	1
There is a reason this group has 5 stars !	1
And the fries were pretty horrible - oversalted and dry .	0
Very Friendly service !	1
Really hope the manager reads this and can make changes as far as her customer service attitude and gum chewing habit .	0

Docking a star because I find that depending on which employee is working when I pick Max up , I do n't always get very knowledgable feedback about how he did .	1
These are the worst seat covers I have ever purchased .	0
They let you try it before you buy it so that 's also nice of them haha !	1
We were supposed to stay Friday , Saturday , and Sunday nights and thankfully they gave us a refund from Saturday and Sunday even though it should have been for all three nights .	0
It was a hostile and horrible racist act , and I hope others do n't support a business like this .	0
Really awesome place to dine at .	1
The venue felt the most luxurious , it was the most beautifully decorated , and there were plenty of things to try - a couple steam rooms , a couple saunas ( both aromatherapeutic , one with bergamot essential oil and the other lavender !	1
They also offered packing service , which I ca n't express how helpful that was .	1
That 's a scam .	0
The security refuses to get in contact with me and dodges my call .	0
Egg rolls- so good !	1
Typical 7/11 stuff with a good variety and selection of beers and wine !	1
And I 'm pretty sure their secret sauce is laced with an illegal substance .	1

I 've had the corned beef omelette , twice , boring , flavorless .	0

I wo n't be returning based on my first visit .	0
Had the nerve to ask `` Are you sure she is getting married '' wth ?	0
I ordered a Turkey sandwich ; the bread was soggy and dripping with grease .	0
The staff is polite and helpful and the prices are very reasonable , probably because this is a not-for-profit operation .	1
It 's not sweet and it has a nice subtle orange peel flavor to it .	1
when I asked for extra bowl and fork the waitress was irritated and sarcastically asked if theres anything else ... Not a good experience .... Never come back .... Ive had way better experience in other locations ...	1
What a deal !	1
By all means this is the most authentic Irish pub in Montreal .	1

Rice was soaked in canola oil and the chicken dishes tasted clearly like some microwave package .	0
The owner is very friendly and took us into the kitchen and showed us how the meat was cooked and all the food was homemade .	1
They rudely told me oh no , we always get at $ 10 or more each for a pic .	1
We did n't wan na complain anymore at that point because the servers probably work with what they have but their food just is n't good at all .	0
I 'm not happy at all with what happened today .	0
Service was great and the food was excellent .	1
While he was there , he did n't even bother to refill my bf 's empty cup of water .	0
This lack of customer service was unfortunate as it made us feel uncomfortable for requesting an exception to the policy in lieu of our less than stellar dining experience .	0
I am guessing this is the result of bad management .	0
So if you want the true strong flavors of ramen , please , spend the extra 4 quarters on a tasty rich broth .	1
A cool seating area and fully stocked bar .	1
It 's mixed in along with a cluster of other clubs and bars in Old Town Scottsdale but has a very unique vibe .	1
Now whenever I come back I stock up !	1
Service was good and we lo ed the environment and atmosphere , casual but classy .	1

We tried the jerk turkey burger and chicken sandwich as well as the Mac n cheese- all of it was really tasty .	1

But if you 're into the fancy stuff you 'll like it .	1
The pizza was limp and soggy .	0
As much as I like their food , I doubt I will go back because I do n't think I should pay extra money for a kids meal just because I am an adult .	0
The staff is always nice and they 're like a big family .	1
Always love hanging out in this part of I would Tukey and the living room makes it a fun time .	1

Russell the manager is great and Ray and Shawna are awesome !	1
Gentleman named `` Mike '' failed to inform me that the work performed was work that should have been covered under drive train warranty .	0
But they did n't give me the courtesy , so I 'm not sure why they are a gift making business that does n't respect delivery windows .	0
Only thing I was disappointed in was I was under the impression that I was going to be breathing out smoke upon consumption , but it was only smokey during the process of making .	1
The restaurant is super cute and the service is SO personable , kind and positive .	1
The final straw was your contemptible response to me when I asked if you cared that you were ruining my 60th birthday .	0

Their selection of cars is unbelievable and their staff was amazing .	1
And the worst part is , they inspect each and every individual crab leg before they put it on their plate without giving a SH * T that there 's a mile long line behind them .	1
When we got to the office I was telling the lady at the front desk some of my cats symptoms , she said `` oh my , sound like something is really wrong .	1

For my fellow deep tissue lovers come one come all .	1

Saw it had good ratings but I am very unhappy .	0
Full fledged nickle & dime airline .	0
While the evening went well , towards the end the bartenders were more sloshed than then partiers [ and observed taking multiple shots ] and refused to serve us water unless we paid $ 1- $ 3 OR flashed our lady parts .	0

I 've never had this happen before , and he was really rude about it , so we left and wo n't be returning .	0
I 've stayed here twice and the staff was beyond excellent both times .	1
Great brunch spot .	1
It took me arguing with the guy for 20 minutes to get him to finally call the manager to issue a refund .	0
Finally a neighborhood spot for us to frequent ... YAY ! !	1
But what I brought it in for was working perfectly !	1
We paid for him so we could be seated , after lunch called the manager over and received a full refund for him .	0

This place was amazing !	1
Loved it !	1
The icing tasted like buttercream crisco , something I am sure I could make and the cake was dry ..	0

We came here for dinner last night and we had a very enjoyable evening .	1

; )	1
I have n't been to a Rock Bottom since I got really , really crappy service at the one in Chandler 11 years ago .	1
They also have a stuffed potato which is personally my favorite stuffed potato from anywhere .	1
Only positive thing was the avocado milkshake 5 of us ordered , that tasted good .	0
But whatever ... We figured mistakes happen and they have a business to run .	0
The wraps were bomb , and we 'll definitely be back !	1
Not only was our ride stylish and comfortable , Kevin kept us entertained and informed throughout the trip by providing insights into local landmarks , details about our destinations , and answering any questions we had .	1
My husband also did leave hungry which is never a good sign .	0
I attempted to call CarMax because I felt I was being penalized on what the previous owner did since I took care of the car .	0

Way to expensive for the quality of food and the terrible service they provide .	0
The food was mediocre at best .	0
It is a bummer that they are closed on Sundays !	1
I particularly enjoyed the taste as I always love my food spicy .	1

When I told the waiter how salty the food was i was told `` yeah the soy sauce makes it salty '' .	0
I had to call `` AC A '' day after day , A string of `` AC A '' 's clueless technicians came , charged me for labor , but could n't get the AC to blow cold air .	1

This hole in the wall ( 4 small tables , maybe 12 chairs ) has to be one of the best , if not the best , bbq joints in town !	1
Sooooooo bad .	0
WHY IS THERE NOT A COUPON FUCKING CHECK OUT LANE ?	0
Such an utter disappointment .	0
To start , the foccaccia and burratta were delicious .	1
People get really pissed off for waiting in line so long just to find out something like that .	0
I grew up in Texas and love coming here for the brisket and the chicken fried steak .	1
I definitely will not be going back .	0
The service is actually surprisingly good .	1
My friends order was overcook and when we asked for a new one the waiter did n't ask what she got so he brought out a different meal and then we were charged for both meals .	1
So at this point I ca n't even leave because my nails have been completely filed down , but then I wait ANOTHER 20 minutes .	0
They have a great variety of herbs in various forms ( loose , powdered , tinctures etc . )	1
It is certainly the worst now .	0
Next time I 'm in Vegas I will be back ! !	1
The food is a joke .	0
Adorable ladies that are all smiles and almost make you feel bad that they 're serving such terrible food .	0
I only wish we had time to go back for breakfast so I could have tried the fried chicken and waffles .	1
I love it !	1
However , I think it 's really unacceptable that esurranty representatives do not answer you , they do not answer the phone ( despite asking you to call by giving you the number on their website ) and they ONLY respond if you leave a negative review .	0
It gets busy but they keep the lines moving without making you feel rushed .	1
Never again .	0

So fresh and flavorful !	1
For the price I would not go again .	0

Then , I was told I would be receiving an itemized list of deductions with whatever balance I would owe in the mail and via email .	0
This place is beyond great .	1
The service and atmosphere compliment the superb food .	1
But I still ended up waiting over 20 minutes for my order because the staff was more interested in goofing off than actually working .	0
At this point the lady ringing me up asked for assistance from another girl .	1
I can not stress enough how fantastic our interaction was with Wayne and this company .	1
He then proceeded to pull out a flashlight and point at the ground , again without saying anything .	0
STAY AWAY .	0

Earns 4/5 stars as it is great for what it tries to be ... a simple , clean , really fresh fish & chips place .	1
Major disappointment ....	0
The fries are always piping hot .	1
On my opinion they do not deserve to make money if this is how they respect their customers .	0
Horribly slow service .	0
The best food The best family run Very quick service I am a regular Come eat here and discover the taste of that good old grill .	1
It 's a skill game ... like pinball .	0
I waited a few seconds to see if he would notice that I did n't order this , it passed so I said `` I did n't ask for another one '' , he replied with `` Relax '' in a condescending tone and took the drink away .	0
The atmosphere is stunning and I believe it 's the National Music Centre that obviously adds the compliment .	1
This idea is fantastic .	1
Waiter had fantastic wine pairings for each course .	1
It 's a nice-looking library in a safe neighborhood , and I love that it 's open on Sundays .	1
I think the founder of Papa Johns is a d-bag , and Dominos is just flat out awful .	1
I 'm so disgusted I want to go home early .	0
We tend toward the `` Kosher '' fish ... salmon , whitefish , tuna , halibut ... and we were completely happy with all of our selections .	1
I was then told 2k down .	0
The sales lady then tried to tell me that it would be a lack of integrity to promise a price that ends that day and then provide the same price at a later date .	0
This is the worst taxi business ever ! ! !	0
Every time we 've been here we 've paired our meal with the wine flight .	1
I had organized my parents 40th Anniversary dinner there .	1
I ca n't believe I just paid $ 10 for that pathetic excuse for a plain burger .	0

At the conclusion of the exam I was helped by Yamile who completed the process of getting my contacts and answering my questions !	1
We brought this up , and after an apology they took this to the back .	0
No pressure or upsell .	1
His office manager insisted that he do his own exam at the cost of $ 25.00 which insurance would not cover .	0
The frites had a very bland taste and there was only one small piece of chicken .	0
I 'll be back for the buck a shuck !	1

The potato mash was overly buttery , the vegetables were soggy with zero seasoning and the yorkshire pudding was over done but the only yummy thing on my plate .	0
Ed was very helpful walking us through his stock and laying out the rugs we liked the best so we could see how they looked and compare to each other .	1
Stomachs growling and stumbled upon this spot .	1
They forgot the teddy bear which was the whole point of the surprise and when I called to ask what happened the lady said `` its hectic in here , what do you want us to do ? ''	0
I would n't recommend Century Link to anyone I like .	0
They only care about booking out all the rooms to make as much money as they can , and dont care about their customers at all .	0
Little to say back not going back .	0
She then started arguing with me .	0
The entire experience for me was great and perfect .	1
After I spent 20 minutes finding the receipt number they then asked me to give me entire credit card information through the phone .	0
Having never been questioned by staff , how could we know that within the Life Time website they disallowed anyone from bringing in the same guest more than once in a 60-day period .	0
Well we talked to someone hours after that car was totaled , so that excuse did n't work with us .	0
Way over priced and way disgusting .	0
The deserts were the biggest disappointment .	0
I wo n't be returning here ever again .	0

It was the yummiest , juiciest burger I 've had in years .	1
Would love to come back and try all the bruschettas !	1
I 'm extremely frustrated because they had NO system or order in place .	0
Apparently all of their juices are made in house too .	1
Then the LED screens become transparent and there 's a parade of sculpted bodies and beautiful characters striking poses in front of a live camera then blasted right on the big screens .	1
When I challenged him regarding something I had said he replied `` Are you saying the I 'm lying ? ! ''	0
I love love love the white tuna , it melts in your mouth .	1

I left in tears and told them I would never leave my children in a place that treated my kids and yelled at them in that way and if she does n't have patience in the child care industry then maybe she should look elsewhere for a job .	0
I 'm definitely a repeat customer ( and have been since 2013 ) , and even the owners know me by name !	1
We shared a house salad with blue cheese and it was very good .	0
Nothing bad about it , just that it 's not as savory as it looks , though you can add whatever sauces you want .	1
Back on hold for 15 minutes , waiting for a supervisor .	0
The customer service is beyond awful , I ca n't even imagine trying to make a claim with this company .	0
I 've given it 2 chances in which both times my food was overpriced and gross .	0
The soufflé is a must to round out a wonderful evening .	1
You wait in line for 30 minutes for an $ 8 cold breakfast sandwich that is greasy on a horrible bun .	0
Prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere was great .	1
Thank god we walked out and did not lease from those sorry excuse of people .	0
BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER !	1
Love this place !	1
I also think their prices , while definitely not cheap , are reasonable , especially when you consider how much pasta you get in the big bowls .	1
The décor is like a steampunk train station and the seating area is open and offers a few different levels along with a large outdoor patio .	1
Tim & Jerry were both so accommodating & nice !	1
They wo n't even refund the baggage fee .	0
So tender and with a hint of sweetness from the brown sugar .	1
I think it 's worth a trip just to see old style Vegas , and the famous lit up cowboy .	1
Honestly , am a loyal customer of BMW , I been visit many BMW and MINI branches , i have been met lots of car agents in many different branches , THIS IS THE WORST I 've never experienced before !	0
I feel almost weightless and am completely happy I found Space .	1
It is because of your choice to do this that I and many other people I have told this to will not be back to your hotel/casino .	0
I personally would not recommend this place .	0
Been a member for about a year and like many of the previous reviews state , the new changes are terrible .	0
They also have a bakery featuring vegan and gluten-free items , bread from Batch Bakery and Madison Sourdough as well as other national brands , a deli counter where you can also get sandwiches made on the spot , a salad bar , and fresh seafood .	1
Well deserved 5 STAR rating !	1
Perfect spot for sports and some beer .	1
It 's made fresh when you order it ! ! !	1
I requested to speak with the manager and explained how upset I was that I could be treated that way ... how does a restaurant let a customer walk away without their meal ?	0
Multiple emails and calls to them , the lastest is `` we do not care it is defective '' and `` do not care if we have bad reviews . ''	0
Staff was very defensive when I told them my latte was not double shot , like how i ordered and paid .	0
Sharon near the pro check out always has a smile on her face does n't matter what time of day it is .	1
I will never return to this car wash again .	0

Dr. Constance Organek is amazing !	1
I love all the ladies in this office !	1
I just wo n't be going back frequently .	1
bland and gross ... definitely not worth even a penny and customer service is crappy too	0
Our bill was outrageous for just mediocre food .	0
After waiting 1.5hrs I finally get my car back see that there is a cluster of chipped paint on my trunk .	0
It was super yummy .	1
It is absolutely illegal to doctor an agreement after both parties have signed it .	0
It had n't been cleaned since the last time ( and probably the last several times ) milk had been steamed in it , so there was dried milk caked on the edges .	0
Yes , your food does n't come out as quick as it would if you were at Denny's- but it 's well worth the wait .	1
Finally got a seat and no one came to clean my table , just horrible service .	0
Their restaurant has been featured on their site for years , which i proceeded to show my waitress on my phone , but she had no response .	0
We were very disappointed with our experience tonight .	0
Unfortunately , i wont be returning .	0
Highly disappointing visit during restaurant week .	0
SERVICE WAS SO BAD ... First off the wait to order the food 20 mins food comes out ... COLD we asked for the check and the guy ignored us and walked away !	0

I got that instant reply saying my message has been sent .	0
* Everything goes smoothly until you pay $ 200 deposit , then your arms will be twisted * Yuri ( owner ) is argumentative and confrontational .	0
He did n't sound happy to be there or anything , we felt as if we were a bother wtf .	0
I have a three year old daughter with autism and she is a very picky eater .	0
In the actual session he was very patient and soothing ( it was my first tattoo , so I was nervous ) .	1
I definitely recommend this place .	1
The staff was snotty , not attentive and rude .	0
From the pineapple exfoliant to the cherry mask I was in heaven .	1
I really love the food here .	0
Might I add it was most enjoyable .	1
I love the chili and bluecheese slaw with red onions .	1
South Side has really really good food .	1
Would recommend : - Altar boy burger - Deep fried cauliflower - Rosemary 's baby	1
Just spend the $ 75- $ 85 somewhere else that will actually fix it .	0
At that point , I was mad and I asked to speak to the owner/manager especially since this behavior was unacceptable and he said that `` he is the owner '' .	0
Next time I go I will eat in so I can try some !	1
Absolutely the worst place ive ever been .	0
Yes , they now are trying to over charge me an even more massive amount that will add another $ 200 a month to my payment .	0
I absolutely love this animal hospital !	1
I like the Crazy Mocha chain !	1
Enjoyed dinner on the patio and happy to report it lived up to all the reviews .	1
Worst first experience .	0
The hotel 's breakfast area is big but they have such a good business that it is hard to find a seating area in the morning .	1
Definitely recommend .	1
The process of actually getting my nails done was awful because she was going way too fast and knicking my skin .	0
Held a private function as Enrico 's last Saturday night and it was wonderful .	1
The Philly cheesesteak was like a half-ass sandwich , barely filled at all , also freezing cold .	0
I have done a wide variety of massages , but the foot massage is by far the best !	1
i think they give you a complimentary plate of tapas during happy hours .	1
I ordered French toast they have a Jamms version which is delicious ! ! !	1
I went here a few years ago , the food sucked for the price and they took a tip out without asking me first .	0
For my fellow Utahns , they got your favorite thing here ... the Fry Sauce .	1
If there were a negative star for this hospital that 's what I would give it .	0
Open aired hotel lobby with lots of natural light ! !	1
Fresh baked cookies delivered warm to your door .	1
At that time she pointed out the tiny sign near where u deposit your money saying only 25 bills .	0
So you get to see the chef in action !	1
A different person proceeds to bring us 2 plates of salmon not what we ordered and some kind of imitation crab thing .	0
The sales guys are obviously disgruntled ...	0
Plus you cant go wrong with crinkle fries .	1
I do n't usually like Pan asian or any sort of fusion , but I thoroughly enjoyed it here .	1
Very unfriendly and offer poor customer service .	0
They still have not faxed Walgreens to confirn the script .	0
I ca n't wait to return to Pittsburgh for these pancakes .	1
I probably should have said this cookie is not acceptable and I do n't want it .	0
Choking down this abomination ruined my day and put me in a bad mood .	0
The size of the tacos are street size , so get multiple if you get any !	1
It is n't super quick or cheap , but it 's well worth it .	1
The Tom Kha soup was the BEST I 've ever had !	1
I wo n't be coming back !	0
Just an update -- I previously complained that the food was going downhill after they changed chefs .	1
They have like a variety of breakfast goodies and the ones that we had tried are so good and fresh .	1
If you get a chance to eat here during a Sunny Toronto day , it is definitely worth it .	1
The place gets very busy but still holds its intimate feel .	1
Definitely check this place out !	1
By far , this is the BEST salad I 've had that I was dying for the recipe .	1
Id say you cant go wrong here with the pho .	1
We were greeted & seated immediately by a great staff .	1
It comes with ginger sticky rice that is to die for .	1
I was supposed to have the manager call me today to discuss these issues .	0
They were fabulous !	1
The price for the drinks is pretty expensive but pizza worth every penny .	1
Best Place in the area !	1
These experiences leave me sad , and frankly , when they said they did n't have the food we wanted , we just should have walked out .	0
Not impressed , waiter was too comfortable/casual with us .	0
It 's a simple show with classic tunes , superb singing , and live instrument playing .	1
Small and cosy !	1
I love coming with family or the wife .	1
He did not want to help me at all , did n't even offer to give me the chicken nuggets .	0
After ordering a refreshing mimosa , I decided to go with the noodle bowl .	1
I never ever had a yelp but decided to make one just because of the horrible service I received .	0

My car was broken in to in a lot by the fair grounds , so I called nonemergency dispatch and asked for a police officer to come and help me .	0
Terrible service across the board .	0
( Did I mention they sat these same underage people , including a 7 year old in the bar ? )	0
The coffee is there as well as water should you choose to indulge .	1
I 'm not sure how a restaurant like this has such poor execution and service .	0
I booked this through expedia , and the Website clearly stated that there were no resort fees , just $ 45 total for two weeknights .	0
I understand that things come up , but 3 times seemed a bit much , very unprofessional .	0
Super cool to have an auto repair shop I trust !	1
Here is the kicker they tried to charge my card the difference .	0
I sent a private message asking a simple question with regards as to how they would send me the info to pay dues without using their auto-pay system , was it going to be in an email or us mail etc .	0
She 's remodeled herself and made it feel homey .	1
I can understand if you need to re-schedule due to an ongoing family emergency but to have me waste my time and money driving to the salon , was plain rude !	0
Everything is well priced and delicious !	1
Just had lunch here this afternoon , and I must say , incredibly disappointed with everything from the service to some of the food .	0
It was probably the best pancake I 've ever had .	1
the place was not that busy , so there really was no excuse .	0
I have to admit that this was TRULY TRULY disappointing .	0
I had never been to Las Vegas before so I have no other Vegas experiences to compare it to , but it was amazing !	1
The crowd is a little on the older side ( bar is packed with 60-year-old+ patrons ) but other than that , Wildfish is definitely a good happy hour spot gem in Old Town Scottsdale .	1
I 've followed owner Johnny Chu through several of his Asian dining concepts , and I must say that this one is the best in its all-around atmosphere , bar setting , and tapas selection .	1
Service , more than food keeps me coming back .	1
No one EVER answers the phone , I have let the phone ring up to 40 times with no answer , no voicemail .	0
They have a limited seating space , and if you reserve , they have private seating area 4/5 stars Service : This is where I think they shine .	1
This is the worst car wash ever ... and its getting worse .	0
I thought it was also quite a bit racist of him to then ask every Asian person walking to the door if they were in our party ... Wth .	0
I find them to be extremely unorganized and just an overall unfriendly .	0
the all american was a classic sandwich but the bread was delicious !	1
The last one I asked told me that they do n't have what I was looking for .	0
Needles to say I will never go back to Dr. Swarup or the Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital again .	0
The decor is simple yet elegant , and environment is very comfortable , clean and spacious .	1
Today was my first time trying Pho and this place did not disappoint I got the D2 rare beef pho and it was delicious .	1
do n't waste your money here ... way over priced & poor quality of food , the ribs were DRY and the brisket was n't much better , potatoes were cold .	0
The pico de gallo was flavourless .	0
Do n't waste the money here !	0
In addition to this , I was told they had the car repainted for me ( when in reality this specific car had recalls on it for the paint issues .	0
By the food was tasteless and service left something to be desired .	0
When I asked for them to put the football game on the TV they gave me attitude and put on some baseball game that no one cared about .	0
They should be required to give me a refund for selling a service that they could not provide what they advertised and sold .	0
I have since recommended the place to all my close friends and family .	1
I do n't know whether it is nepotism in the host positions or a complete lack of respect for their clientele .	0
I did n't not get my order until 5:50 after I had asked the busser for my order .	0
They soaked my nails off and now I 'm stuck to wait for the service because who wants to walk around with gross uneven , unfiled nails .	0
Will definitely be back : )	1
How unfortunate for all of our friends that we did that because if ANYTHING goes wrong with any of those thousands of dollar purchases , your employees will make sure that these customers are totally unhappy and regret their decision .	0
All of these things I could 've over looked of the staff had n't been so rude .	0
Tons of flavors to choose from , and they 're always adding seasonal tastes as well !	1
Literally the worst service i have ever received or should I say no service .	0
Lets see ... Bartenders are wack as hell considering they ca n't even remember who is next to make drinks for ...	0
love love love !	1
Then the valves broke and he claims it is my pool builders fault and the wiring is a mess , ,blah blah blah to hide the fact that he is incompetent !	0
I asked for a refund , he said no !	0
Not worth the aggravation !	0
I earned already $ 2 : D Overall good and convenient location .	1
The only problem was it was served barely warm .. almost cool .	1
The manager does not belong in the service industry .	0
His sheer genius when it comes to color has added depth and dimension to my natural red hair .	1
A nearby coffee shop owner recommended Sweet Moses to soothe our dessert cravings , and man were we glad he did .	1
The only gripe about visiting here is the shopping center 's parking lot .	1
A prosthetic device or a brace for a disability is the same regardless of where it comes from SHAME on MTD for not honoring veterans .	0

After waiting 10 minutes I asked the cashier if she could check on my order , which she promptly did with Faye , who I am assuming was the supervisor of the day , and who was also staffing drive thru .	0

The basil green beans were an excellent choice to round out my healthy meal !	1

Instead we got bland gross boiled chicken and the pho was tasteless .	0
Everything about it was perfect and just as I had remembered it should taste , and the falafel and baklava might have been the best I 've ever tasted .	1
They have a lot of good stores and service is great !	1

Great cider selection and an even greater outdoor area to enjoy it all in .	1
Great burgers made to order with steak .	1
The staff there is amazing and make you feel very comfortable .	1
I will say that my rating is directed solely at the corporate officers that think it 's ok to charge above market prices for sub par amenities and is not a reflection of the hotel staff as they seem to offer sincere service to their guests .	0

Cheaper than the other wraps ( though all are super cheap given the quality ingredients , this is about $ 4 ) and the staff favorite .	1
so he left with my pizza an drinks completely unacceptable .	0
They never returned my phone calls till months later after I had terminated their services when they noticed the debt .	0
The manager told me he would knock the price down to $ 700 .	1
They were good , but the portion was overly skimpy ( pieced together , it would have made maybe 5 whole chips ) and they were n't much different from what you would get from a bag of `` kettle cooked '' chips .	1
I have never seen it before and it was so good I did n't want to share .	1
I would recommend this and I was pretty skeptical at first since it 's a `` bank 's museum '' .	1

I wish I had seen this review before I went yesterday to get a manicure and pedicure or at this horrible trashy salon .	0
So sadly Thuet sucks tried the meringue which is another basic but important item to measure by was horrible .	0
i thought there was too much dough ( way too chewy and under cooked ) , the sauce was salty , w/ the cheese it made it worse , and it was a waste of my money .	0
Price is awesome as well .	1
Our patio furniture was just delivered this week and it 's perfect .	1

Worse decision ever .	0
in confused as to how our food gets cancelled when your staff is the one that did n't do her job ?	0
The waitress was the best part of the visit she was trying to help the food and coffee situation out but , I 'd already made up my mind as an unsatisfied customer .	0
This makes no sense to me , if anyone knows the answer please contact me .	0
Never again .... never .... paid twice the price I would have paid at Advantage .	0

As I mentioned , the first 3 supplements were things I could have bought online and he said they were fine to give ( duh , of course probiotics and digestive enzymes would be okay ) BUT the last 2 I was told not to give .	0
The automated message told me there were only 3 calls ahead of me-lost my Xmas business	0
I am horrified at this experience .	0
Dang this place is good !	1
Ended up charging me $ 150 for the worst highlights I 've ever gotten and I 've had my highlights done many , many times .	0
This is an awesome breakfast , late breakfast and lunch place .	1
Best experience ever at any urgent care or regular doctors office !	1
I then told him that he could give me my pipe back ( which he was still pulling brown pipe cleaners out of ) and that I did n't appreciate his condescending attitude .	0
And this pool area was huge !	1
Over thirty minutes late .	0
Yep it 's very really cool the location is perfect food is good and well-made .	1

We will definitely return on our next trip to Mtl .	1
I did try some of the food and I thought the hummus was pretty good but the Bruschetta was excellent .	1
The enchiladas were pretty skimp on the meat , although there was plenty of sauce and cheese , and the rice and beans had no flavor .	1
They argued with me that they could n't take it back except for store credit , which was a no go for me .	1
I will not be ordering or entering any Jimmy Johns establishment again .	0
not worth your time .	0
A must see for sure !	1
Who ever is running this place should be fired ! ! !	0
I visited Vero on a Friday night after a wonderful concert by the Cleveland Orchestra and pianist Murray Perahia .	1
Wi-Fi does not work and cell phone coverage is terrible .	0

This free Christmas attraction is something we must absolutely visit every year with my in-laws- we love it .	1
-she used the tip of her fake nail to clean the edges of my nails , which just smothered the clumpy polish even more .	0
The rolls did fall apart a little and could have been packed tithgter but the overall quality was terrific and the price was good .	1
Aesthetically , it 's super swingin ' and snazzy , but the AC was insufficient and the service is beyond terrible .	0
Their cinnamon `` scuffins '' ( if scones and muffins mated ) are excellent and hubby likes the cinnamon rolls ( not my fave ) .	1
Got my golden tix a few days before my dinner and i was ready to go !	1
It was oh so tasty and the meat was tender and juicy .	1
At one corporate dinner for 10 they tried to tell us we could not order dessert because there was another group taking over our table , after they had taken 1.5 hours to bring out our mains - completely unacceptable .	0
It was just plain disgusting .	0
Do not trust them , they will lie and tell you one price , but if it takes longer than they thought to clean your house , they will raise the price .	0
I think I may go there again on the way out of town too !	1
Now I have a package from Fanatics.com that was to be delivered on 9/5 , ... still not here , all i get is a canned response from `` Justin '' via email when asking for an update .	0
I had told him repeatedly that I had already called the bank and got the unauthorized charges refunded so the money was there .	0
The only disappointment was Payard where all we tasted was a truffle and a macaroon ( we really wanted to try the crepes , which they prepared for us but we did n't get to taste for some reason ) .	1
The owner was incredibly helpful when we needed him .	1
Again , no response ..	0
Highly recommend the spot if you 're in the area	1
I totally understand that , but a call informing me of that BEFORE my delivery was supposed to arrive would have been nice .	0
He was extremely helpful and informed me that I was eligible for a free tablet and a plan change which would make my overall total every month cheaper by $ 5 .	0
They offer group classes and private lessons .	1
Plus they only have a 1/3 of a casino open and an inadequate number of front desk staff to manage the guest check in and phones ... The hotel is obviously under renovation .	0
Service is very friendly , and while not super fast , not slow either .	1
But the alterations manager was down right horrible .	0
Keep it classy Nick !	0
In addition , my poached egg was terribly over-cooked , even though I had requested an egg with a runny yolk .	0
Instead , I received cold pasta , dried up sauce that the noodles soaked up , and dry , scrawny , unseasoned chicken on top .	0
The food , service , atmosphere , and Mac & Cheese was amazing !	1
Though it should have cooked the salmon sushi too , it did n't because the salmon was still frozen ! !	0

So creamy , so perfect , so right .	1
It 's a small and unassuming restaurant .	1
We can each do our part , however , by knowing our neighbors , reporting suspicious activity , letting the office know when you see any security concerns ( lights out , secured gates not locking , etc ) .	1
Finally , and most satisfying , the banana pudding was Reason # 3 to come back .	1
Also incredible .	1
The service is absolutely atrocious .	0
The portions the flavors of the dish here are big and well worth every penny .	1
This was by far the worst delivery experience I have ever had .	0
The beef was flavorful , and love the spicy sauce drizzled on top .	1
When you mark up the wine 300 % it seems insulting to charge for sauce .	1
That was the most disappointing part , as I had taken off time from work to have this prescription renewed .	0
I then mentioned I need to go to work and she said `` ok well we stop doing notary at 530 '' .	0
The chicken was bland and dry .	0
I loved it , but if that 's not for you they also have a build your own pizza option to make your pizza dreams come true .	1
I love the way it 's decorated inside , it feels very hip !	1
Tonight the delivery driver literally hands me my pizza and wings then tells me I need to sign the receipt .	1
Without my permission started putting my information in their system .	0
Later , I went to a different lash salon and told me what a horrible job she did -- not isolating the lashes and clumping them together .	0

I will never do business with any AutoNation branch ever again .	0
They covered the whole slice with mushrooms !	1
Nice enough guy and I would 've been alright with things except instead of acknowledging the poor service , he made the excuse for his staff that there had been a `` simultaneous seating '' which was FAR from true .	0
However , I could n't attend the last three weeks and they refused to refund me for those three weeks , which is why you should n't commit to a contract here : you 're almost guaranteed to get injured .	0
I would never go there again .	0

Definitely worth checking out .	1
I would actually like to rate it a 2.5 but I 'm being kind and rounding up because I am hugely appreciative of what they have done with the building .	0

Overall , not impressed with this place based on the price they want .	0
sweet crepes , egg breakfast crepes , and lunch crepes !	1
- My only compensation for the extra rental car expense I 've had is $ 250 of a $ 1,225 bill .	0

Black Coffee and Espresso : 5.0 Lattes n such : 4.5 Food : 4.0 After better exploring the relatively small ( but rapidly expanding ) Phoenix Coffee market , Infusion remains one of Phoenix 's best roasters and best shops .	1
The beers are solid - with the Amber being my favorite .	1
Authenticity is what makes places like Shwartz 's , Beauty 's , Wilensky 's and other Montreal favorites the institutions they are and the Casse Croute has it in spades .	1

Very , very disappointed .	0
Nails came out great ! ! !	1

The most famous buffet in Las Vegas , the Bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace is delicious and filling , but pretty darn expensive .	1

I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the place was and how quickly we were seated ( I was in a group of 6 , and we got there a little after 1pm ) .	1

My friends arrived before me and were told that we didnt have an appointment , my friend called me and told me , I told her who I spoke with and my friend again told the nail tech we had an appointment .	0
This tile work is not acceptable and must be removed and reinstalled by a true professional-not someone working out of the trunk of an old car arriving very late .	0

I will never recommend them again .	0

Staff : Very friendly .	1
I figured that Regus would have been reasonable enough to help us out but it was stated in our original contract we are responsible for the fees so I guess they have a `` gotcha '' on that one .	0
The first 10 or so minutes I can forgive but when I actively am trying to flag someone down and literally every employee refuses to make eye contact , even I start to get frustrated .	0
The bartenders are awesome and very attentive , I 'm definitely going back with more people .	1
Then again , maybe he took a hint because after our food was dropped off he was nowhere to be found .	0

No compensation was offered and only an apology from the waitress who said it has been this kind of delay all week .	0
The meat to topping ratio was 50/50 ; meat had no flavour ; toppings were low quality ; and , without asking , they put some kind of mushy and nasty cabbage in it .	0

Melodi is always prompt and greets me as a friend .	1
Awesome ! ! !	1
The food was mediocre at best and the restaurant itself is poorly designed - I could clearly hear the conversation at the bar from my table 6 feet away .	0
It 's got a bit of the cross fit feel ( which I usually do n't like ) , but the instructors are friendly , encouraging , pay attention to your form , and do not allow the environment to become too competitive .	1

Great Italian place .	1
The food is amazing .	1

This is a great place to go watch the games or to just relax after a long day .	1
Loads of natural light , well-spaced seating , yet cant be bigger than the living room and kitchen of your grandparents 1960 style ranch .	1

There was no music to drown out the traffic noise from the street , not very relaxing , when she finally did find the creams and brushes she put me under the steamer for another 20 mins so 40 mins have passed and she 's hardly touched me .	0
To avoid dealing with management again , I just went to the store and purchase a Mr. Clean eraser and bleach and cleaned it myself .	0
If , on the other hand , you like your liquor served straight with bitter citrus pulp , you will definitely love this place .	0

If you cant handle the order volume , do n't say you can do delivery in 20-30min and then not answer the phone when a customer tries to contact you .	0
Our host was awesome and he was super sweet and chatty .	1
It 's nothing fancy and you wo n't find a four course meal , but it does the trick and that 's all that really matters !	1

Behind the bar , there were seats and a games area where people can actually sit and play board games and order food , In addition to other games such as darts across from the seating area .	1
Service was terribly slow and the waitress seemed a little `` dizzy '' , I had to keep asking for water even though she kept walking by and could see our entire table had no water .	1
Excellent flavors and portions .	1
The movie and play matched up well together ; the stage effects made it almost as if you were watching a movie .	1
Upon looking at my paperwork later , I noticed that there were 3 areas on the multipoint inspection form that stated `` needs immediate attention '' and I never was informed of this .	0
I cancelled all orders .... Military discount is nice as they verify on line , but it is NOT worth their customer service .	0
I did not hear from them the next day so I went through the paperwork in the folder and filled out the cancellation form and faxed it in .	0

Some rogue customers to flaunt their heroism might be buying hefty priced items but avoid this store you will be losing at least tens of dollars on each visit and probably hundreds each month depending on your purchase volume .	0
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY ! !	0
Otherwise zero stars is warranted .	0
Do not go anywhere else ! !	1
The room was disgusting .	0
I 'm in Heaven ! ! ! !	1
They were n't rude and when we pointed out the mistake they did n't fight us .	0

Just about the only decent thing was the bacon .	0

There 's always a happy hour special going on and the bar and restaurant sides are totally separate , which is great for both families and the no-kid crowd .	1
We were here in October 2018 with a large group and had a great time and the trash can nachos were amazing ! ! !	1
Will definitely come back for the amazing servers , food , and atmosphere !	1

Forget how bad the food was , the service sucked along with his attitude .	0
Service sucks !	0

When she called to tell me the price I asked if she could do any better than that and she said no so I drove all the way to the shop to pick up my dress ...	0
I will not return .	0
The smashed potatoes with roasted garlic was also excellent , however , a little deceiving ... Its really just smooth creamy mashed potatoes ( no chunks ) .	1
But the fact that we called ahead to make specific reservations , then be treated so rudely by the girl at the front desk with long black curly hair is unacceptable .	0
La Poule Mouille makes it absolutely perfectly .	1
The salon was really nice and serene , a very calming atmosphere .	1
The aioli was sharp and also very good .	1
Simply not possible with no apology says the pet resort .	0
The pesto & bread that 's served before the meal is the best !	1

In comparison to other sandwich shops , Jimmy Johns is not the best nor the worst .	1

They probably should start integrating the computer into their record keeping since we have submitted proof of the required renters insurance three times now and keep getting harassed for the proof .	0

This store had mini containers that were perfect for my needs .	1
This is our go-to for takeout since they opened about 2 years ago .	1
It has the flavor of a New York cheesecake but in contrast , it 's light and fluffy .	1
The White Castle sliders in the frozen section in most grocery stores tastes almost EXACTLY like the sliders you will get here , except here , it 's freshly cooked and not soggy !	0
I love this place .	1
And they move incredibly quick during busy times !	1
It is a go-to menu for a chilly day .	1
They seem to never want to take responsibility of their errors down to adding , then removing , then adding back a name on my lease .	0
The Chile Verde was excellent .	1
Spaghetti and Meatballs were tasteless and the sauce was watery and bland , I had to order the meat sauce on the side to add more taste .	0

Still recommend it for good food and atmosphere just off the noise of Fremont street ...	1
I thought the experience was pretty comparable to anywhere else and could n't really justify coming back to pay more just because the walls are pretty .	0
In bacchanal everything is far from good .	0
The lady came back with items that she seemed to be cleaning , did n't acknowledge us and disappeared again .	0

Coming from NYC I am very disappointed in this place .	0

I will be back .	1
The first receptionist I checked in with was also cold and abrasive .	0
Awful , dreadful , terrible .	0

Horrible .	0
For the prices they charge I demand better service .	0

The loss of one star comes from an incident with my man that I was n't even there to witness : A stripper with a banging body but busted face asked to take him on a `` tour '' so her manager would n't get mad .	1
Although we experienced a few foibles in the fulfillment process ( e.g. , my breakfast burro was initially wrapped in a tortilla ( rather than frybread ) and lacked eggs ) , all issues were cheerfully and efficiently resolved for a delicious conclusion !	1
The waitress pretty much ignored all of our signs that we were ready to order and made us wait at least 15 min to even come to see if we had questions .	0
But when we returned the car the guy there told us that we didnt buy the prepaid gas and hence had to pay a 90 $ bill for gas service ( which is a ridiculous mistake ) .	0

Best part was the patio which was festive and spacious .	0
Finally , once my friends paid cash they were n't provided change despite us waiting for some time .	0
While I seriously do n't think it was personal , the service was extremely poor .	0

Very friendly and informative , made the enrollment process fun and easy .	1
Unappetizing pasta came with a tasteless salad with bottled dressing .	0

I 've literally tried just about everything on the menu and have been completely underwhelmed .	0
A Horrible experience !	0
The rest were bland or salty or just plain old awful .	0
To give you an idea of what it is now - there was a cardboard triangle ad on the table that was tacky .	0
What stood out most was that there was no support staff bringing drinks , water , bread , salads .	0
Food 2 stars tonight .	0
I love how different rooms have something going on .	1
The food was awesome and the service was equally outstanding .	1

My hair is my pride and joy .	1
We had talks about health , why she was so thin and all I got was lies .	0
When I asked him what they were gon na do about this he claimed they `` needed time to figure out what to do '' I then told him this was not being handled professionally and could I speak to another owner .	0

I 'll defiantly be back here as I was n't expecting to have such a enjoyable experience in a bar located in the middle of a desert around a bunch of homes .	1
When I asked about my appointment time the guy shrugged and said that 's just the way it is , well not in my world so I left .	0

The worst burger place I 've ever been to .	0
Findlay Chevrolet is like the Donald Trump of car dealerships : they are careless , incompetent , and unwilling to admit their mistakes .	0
Will not return to this place during my travels .	0
Excellent price , great customer service and quality control .	1
I walk in and there 's no apology for making me wait and no thanks for coming in .	0

The food is just awful , so awful .	0
They offered a good mix of recognizable American Chinese dishes ( like orange chicken & spring rolls ) as well as some more authentic Chinese fare , like beef tendon soup .	1

Happy Hour is from 11-6 and all of their amazing cocktails are half off during those hours .	1
The front office was rude and when I tried to discuss that with Marlina , she became incredibly defensive and patronizing .	0
What was very frustrating is when they made it seem like I was crazy and had no clue what I was talking about .	0
He really went out of his way to make sure I had the proper treatment and I 'm very satisfied .	1
Was super dry and bland .	0
She also stated she could n't give me any better of a price on the car I was looking at and laughed when I bluntly told her I did n't want to pay that full amount .	0
It is apparent that the employees of CL are trained to sell in a deceptive manner , bill in a deceptive manner , etc .	0
Love the taste of their coffee beans !	1

It 's a great combination of broccoli , collard greens , tomatoes , and mushrooms under some crispy hash browns topped with Swiss and American ( I think ? )	1
The sweet potato side was absolutely delish .	1
The dining area near the entrance has a huge mural that gives this place it 's feel and vibe .	1
There 's also a pizza oven & a coffee bar ( with a variety of liqueurs ) , both of which smelled amazing !	1
This place is great .	1
I spent over $ 150.00 for three of us to eat and drink .	0
and when u would walk back in the apt it would smell like sewage .	0
We were on the back/side patio and they provided fresh squeezed OJ and champagne for mimosas .	1
I was very unhappy with my experience here .	0
I enjoyed my waffle , which had some added spices that really enhanced the flavor , despite being out of fresh strawberries ( the frozen ones were fine ) .	1
Great sandwiches , burritos and salads .	1
Worst $ 110 I 've ever spent on noodles .	0
Two stars because the story I am about to share is out of the norm , at least for me , but holy yikes , strap in .	0
I find their staff and drivers are proud to work for such a professional service .	1
The worst part is ( mostly ) women fall for it .	0
They make the wrong orders and wont follow simple instructions .	0
Next the food is delicious whether it be breakfast or lunch and the daily special is the best .	1
Now I know they can not solve everything but it goes to the fact that some people in the health care industry are just nasty .	0
Great food and good place to stop by !	1
This place has a very unique layout with arches , indoor outdoor areas , patios , secret entrances .	1
The spicy red sauce is to die for !	1
But the chicken was lackluster and appeared to be overcooked in the fryer .	0
Horrible , horrible , horrible .	0
The crab meat cocktail and the sea bass were both nowhere near fresh .	0
I requested a bunch of quotes from plumbers through Yelp late last night and received a prompt response from Walter with a very reasonable and fair quote .	1
EVERY time I 've been in this place , must be a dozen by now , its been some sort of `` Do n't give a flying +++ '' attitude that just insults me to the point I do n't want to come back .	0
The coffee shop and buffet are hardly edible .	0
I can only judge from my own experience , which was fabulous .	1
Their lack of care is why I will never recommend them to anyone , and will never return .	0
This is beyond poor customer service .	0
Miriam was awesome .	1
My only regret is that they ran out of tamales by the time I got there ( well there was still cheese and pineapple but I say those do n't count ) .	1
But these cost $ 80 and it 's pretty dishonest .	1
After much belaboring they give us a refund for MINI mcflurry !	0
Following a two star rating of Mozart , I have an update .	0
I hosted a business exchange followed by a wine tasting in October and we had an amazing experience !	1
We will never go back .	0
I even saw a girl get mad because someone wasnt paying attention to her so she threw money at him ..	0
My one complaint is that they have changed scoopers to a more traditional ice cream scoop and this means the two flavours are one on top of the other instead of side by side .	1
You ca n't beat the happy hour specials on the oysters .	1
From the time they sat us to end was bad we didnt even get a have a good day when we left .	0

That is so gross that she bussed that table touched all that dirty sliverwear that people ate off of picked up stuff off the dirty floor and did n't wash her hands .	0
My only complaint is music a little loud .	1
Besides the course , staffs are always professional & accommodating .	1
She is very professional and has become a great friend of mine .	1
Can not even begin to explain how HORRIBLE today 's experience was !	0
Also , some of the staff were n't very friendly at times and I saw one of them giving unwarranted attitude to one of the elderly guests .	0
The mushroom ravioli was a great dish as well .	1
She finally agreed to let us be seen right as another woman walked in .	0
It 's my favorite !	1
Worst buffet in Vegas , do n't go there .	0
The frits served with the steak were overdone and a little burnt and the whole experience was actually pathetic .	0
DO NOT GO HERE ! !	0
We eat here quite often and have never had a bad meal .	1
Cashiers were super nice too .	1
We left with a 3 course meal for around $ 60 which is not bad at all for the experience and food we received I would most defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone .	1
Rude check-in personnel & total rewards guy was no help & even ruder than check-in staff .	0
I have tried to call they do not pick up the phone .	0
That got me a voicemail from George saying he was sorry I had gotten so upset , that he had been hospitalized shortly after our communication the week before and that 's the reason he had n't sent the check yet .	0
This place is great .	1
So , i called them saying it wasnt and they said `` Ok we will get it ready for you then '' so i waited and waited for another hour I called and they told me that there was no order for me there .	0
The dental hygienist is great too .	1
My fave place to get my brows threaded whenever I am in Vegas .	1

The man I spoke to was extremely unprofessional , using curse words in front of my 6 year old brother .	0
Generous pour on the wine and delicious beer .	1
When the food was returned on a plate the food was then cold , the ribs were poor in quality of meat and extremely fatty .	0
This was my first time going there and I was a little nervous because I see they do extreme colors that I do n't do to my hair but I loved all the reviews so I took a chance .	1
The ingredients included rotisserie chicken , thick bacon , creamy blue cheese , Granny Smith apples , cranberries , red onions , almond slices , mixed greens and a yummy strawberry vinaigrette dressing .	1
When one lady was trying to take our order , she wasnt even paying attention and walked out to serve someone else in the middle of me ordering ...	1
Service friendly and professional .	1
The only thing that bothers me here is that the seats are dirty and disgusting .	1
Wow , accusing me that I refused to provide this information when she was the one who aggressively kicked me out of the vehicle ?	0
Also- humorous sighting of the day- `` fish and chips '' is listed under the vegetarian part of the menu : )	0

I am so glad I found this catering company for my wedding .	1
Sorry to say , what a disappointment .... 2 people in our party did n't finish their plates , they were so bad .... And we bought one order of fries to split between 3 people and after one bite , it sat untouched .	0
I guess she was forced to try to upsell us a $ 17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous it is and we should n't bother with it .	1
The atmosphere is beautiful , and upscale , with great views .	1
The pudding came warm and not too sweet while the gelato , which is also home-made , perfectly balanced the amaretto-infused cake .	1
Other than that they are really good .	1
This tasted disgusting .	0
So why is he keeping it and why is he refusing to refund us ?	0
Dinner food selection was sparse and tasted ... meh .	0

A complete organic meal !	1
For the things not covered by warranty he gave me different options on how I could proceed and never pressured me to do the most expensive .	1
We did not print the groupon , we could n't pull it up on our phones , and they had no way to help us over the phone ( 30+ min wait to tell us that ) .	1
Love it and we will def be back for more .	1
I love the salsa selection they have .	1
The past couple times I 've been My food was cold and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while .	0

This is one of the most impressive things I 've ever seen , b/c they line each bath with a plastic liner before each client .	1

They have not nor will not return my phone calls .	0
After the deep cleaning and polishing , my mouth feels great , better than it has in quite some time .	1

There 's no egos at Ctown , everyone is in it together and you build a great comradery that is driven by the caring personalities of the coaches who drive and inspire you as you go .	1

I 'm going to say that the place is horribly bad on purpose .	1
Lamb is my fave !	1

Great color and Mindy did a great job matching the design I wanted .. ( it was really busy and I did have to wait about 25 minutes beyond my appointment time - It was a Saturday so I anticipated the wait .. )	1
Although the menu is diverse with lots of drink mixes and topping options , the speciality drinks are all too sweet for me .	1

She then refused to even switch it out for something else .	0
Alexis screwed up on the three entrée one side plate , by adding food and take food off the plate that was not even part of the order and continued to dump the food back into the line in front of customers .	0
But that 's no excuse for treating us like the other 99 % assuming we would n't sign up .	0
We were then greeted by the same guy , he was very defensive and claimed we had used said glass before we brought it back because there was water in it .	0
Looking forward to going back !	1
The food was bland , mushy and overcooked .	0
It was super flavorful and filling !	1

A friend and I decided to visit this little spot after a workout and it was nothing short of perfection !	1

Considering We had to wait 30 mins to even get somebody over in The paint section , we took it , not happy .	0
The frazzled bartender cum waiter looked a bit horrified when we told him we were here for our 9pm reservation and he told us to `` sit back and have a drink , those two are just about to leave '' .	0

Vegas carpet warehouse is the most caring floor business in Las Vegs .	1

The coziest little cafe tucked away on Duluth , featuring great food and excellent WiFi .	1
Antonio and Jose were sent by our home warranty and was not disappointed .	1
I went into Pinky 's to grab some takeout before watching Wrestlemania 30 and it was a great decision .	1
It was only 2 of us , so we did n't sample as much as we normally do , but the quality and freshness of everything was great .	1
Enjoy !	1
They never came back to ask for refills or anything .	1
Scenery : Not amazing , but definitely pretty with some cool parts along the way .	1
The beef roast was dry and even gravy could n't fix the dry and bland taste .	0

Taking our business elsewhere .	0
When i got home i briefly toasted it and omg ... it is STILL so good !	1
I paid $ 188.00 for two tickets and all I can say is what a waste of money !	0
Facilities are out of date and they smell SAVE YOUR MONEY , DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON BODYHEAT	0
They do n't apologize just leave .. Another few minutes no update .	0
the clerks never say hi , welcome or even acknowledge you even when you put your items on the counter to pay for them .	0
It 's unnecessarily stingy and inconvenient .	0
Some parts could be a little greasy , but it 's worth it .	1
So call the cops ?	0
Extraordinarily kind and efficient .	1
THIS IS THE BEST THAI FOOD I 'VE EVER HAD .	1
Sandwich : 110 % Service : 0 % I am beyond pissed .	0
Very creative stuff and the prices are not bad at all !	1
Fresh bread , amazingly good .	1
That moistness was back , and the flavor , bursting with each bite .	1
Croissant and Chocolate Croissant - both very flaky and buttery .	1
We also each indulged in a homemade hot chocolate .	1
Really great for family dinner , dates and any other function .	1

I was told a refund would be forthcoming .	0

Very disappointed .	0
Fed up with the lack of organization and communication with the company we asked for a refund .	0
The food was okay but we were appalled at some things that we observed .	0
- something you would expect at Schwartz ( local super dirty smoked meat place ) , but not Gordon Ramsay 's top notch new place .	0
Completely ignored me for about 10 minutes as they served a white male and could n't even take a second to let me know whether they were ever going to serve me or not .	0
They ruined my car to the point that it was no longer worth repairing .	0
So no one cares about customer satisfaction anymore ?	0
They are very flavorful and I did not have to doctor it up like I do for other local places .	1
Restaurant goer beware !	0
They also have a decent happy hour !	1
They mixed nutter butter in the cream with banana until it became smooth and blended !	1
The smallish , round cake was $ 40 and could n't have served a lot of people , but it 's definitely a recommendation !	1
I also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointments ... and she always has great music playing in the background too !	1
I kept telling myself I should have just left but I did n't see any obviously glaring remarks for here about food poisining .	0
By far , the best Starbucks staff and drinks !	1

They 're very friendly and always apologize for any wait that seems too long .	1
Everything was delicious .	1
One of my favorite places to eat and most definitely the best Thai food I have found in Las Vegas .	1
Staff was very friendly .	1
They even taught Ghost how to swim for the first time .	1
But I was not told that I was `` in '' until I saw everyone filing in and I asked the front desk .	1
I never was served before by him before , and to be fraudulent and verbally aggressive to a regular customer is simply outrageous .	0
WTH ? ? ? ?	0
Awesome little place with really reasonable prices .	1
Chocolate Shake was not thick it was runny and inedible even after I asked them nicely to make it thicker .	0

There 's no reason anyone should be treated how their staff treats people .	0
I would not recommend this place they are even rude to medical device vendors they referred me to .	0
Top it all off with live music and great cocktails for a truly enjoyable evening .	1
Do not use this company these people are a joke !	0
I waited till 8:20 because I was making excuses to myself , maybe they are still making it or they are busy but then I had enough because the place was n't full either for them to have a freaking excuse for taking too long .	0
Mine was bitter and sour and not at all appetizing .	0
Incredible & complimentary for special occasions .	1
Definitely recommended !	1
They will be bringing on new beers and their concept is neat .	1

She made me feel very comfortable and worked out a great plan with me .	1
How fortunate for us that Avondale Toyota was the nearest one .	1
Definitely worth the visit both for the ambiance and the quality and affordability of the food .	1
Waited nearly 2 hrs to see a doctor so he could prescribe drugs .	0
I recommend it for its crunchy texture and seasoning .	1
But then it may be because we are both from Illinois the Land of Lincoln and remember his walking from New Salem to Springfield to return a few pennies he had overcharged a customer !	1
The worst meal I 've ever had in Vegas , and one of the most expensive .	0
This is literally one of the best desserts I have ever had .	1
i realize that rent is expensive at fashion square but the value is horrible	1
Terrible service , terrible food , i was disappointed .	0
I opted for the double vanilla cake with a personalized topper .	1
This place rocked it and has a very cool vibe .	1
Thank you LVAC for changing my body for the better everytime ! !	1
They bait and switch on you co payment with your insurance - before service they verify your co payment after service they send you a bill for more money claiming the insurance did n't cover as they `` expected '' !	0
I felt that this must be a joke .	0
My favorite special is Banana Fudge Krumble on Fresh Banana Nut custard .	1

I go in at least 3 times a week and I 've been to other locations as well , but I wo n't go back and will go the extra distance to this Goodyear location .	1
But I 'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth , as I said , I was very happy to have so many veggie options .	1
As we told the server we wont be eating here after the way I was treated , she said and I quote , `` Well what was said was n't directed at him but you 're free to leave . ''	0
They served food to people who had come after us and still did not get our food after waiting AN HOUR .	0
The sushi itself was OK but not worth running back to .	0
The WORST experience I 've had in Las Vegas .	0
Kaitlyn helped us with our hotel room block and shuttle service and was incredibly responsive , helpful , and kind .	1
The entire bar smells like a cozy campfire , which can be a bit much when you first walk in , but after a minute or two I thoroughly enjoyed it .	1
Stagioni is a fabulous place to eat !	1
A solid 4/5 .	1
The pizza dough is made by scratch and is local , thanks to MJ Bakery .	1
It might sound weird and repulsive but there 's something magical about crunchy , salty , and gooey goodness .	1
In the end , we received our bill from our waitress , who yet once again seemed so annoyed with us , we saw that we had a 20 % service charge .	1
This outlet mall has a good selection of stores ranging from the high-end Armani to basic inexpensive wares from Old Navy .	1
I highly recommend this place !	1
The food was pretty bad too ... the flour tortilla and beef of my taco were extremely dry ... it was painful to eat .	0
Instead , he decided that it was okay to yell and argue back and forth about a process that has been done numerous times .	0

Party of 5 got in easily , all had great meals .	1

The escalation line ; does not return calls nor address the problem at hand .	0

Happy Hour - 4 Stars - They have good daily specials and Happy Hour drink choices .	1
Ordered a couple of their blended cocktails - coral crush ( mango/tropical ) & pina colada - relaxed and did not feel rushed by the server .	1
This thing disappoints .	1
I am giving this place five stars for the food as the Tacos are the bomb and the sauces that you get with them are so damn good as well , get the beet or avocado sauce , they just make the Tacos amazing , which they already are .	1
Then I have Karen , she did a great job .	1
New management no good .	0

When we arrived at the Ace location , the clerk , a middle-aged woman with tattoos and an insulting attitude told us that the rental rate for the car we reserved was $ 36 more than the confirmed rate we had received at booking .	0
We thought it must have been because we were wearing Chicago White Sox gear , but regardless it was very unprofessional we got up and left .	0
Love the mac n cheese , Cheese Steak ( Avon Cheese Steak ) & Pulled Pork & Buffalo Chicken Sliders , fried pickles are good .	1
The soft serve has the perfect creamy and light texture while the chocolate was a great combination of sweet , salty and bitterness .	1
Coffee is always served promptly and politely .	1
The desserts very unique and innovative , saffron chocolate , some sponge looking one with gold dust , chocolate they put in some liquid nitrogen or something to get very unique texture to it .	1
I asked about the payment plan & was told there was no be payment plan option for me .	0

The Boulders Grill also has Stevia in the sugar dish- it 's the first restaurant I have been to that offers Stevia an all natural sugar that is healthier than equal or sweet n low .	1
Their fun cocktails including homemade tonic are a great way to start the experience .	1
No manager de escalated the situation .	0
So far every drink has been really good , including waitress recommendations ( they know their stuff ) , bartender 's choice , and even the 'shot in the dark ' ( bartender 's choice shot ) .	1
Never experienced such rude behavior , especially in Montreal .	0
Why was n't I informed of this until I called ?	0

Not the admitting clerk , the 5 nurses in Outpatient Surgery whose attention this was brought to , not the med records clerk , or anyone else I spoke to by phone ... both before AND after my surgery .	0
But I 've discovered that I 'm a fan of their carnitas too .	1
They said nothing further , I sat and waited for 15 minutes and still nothing was said .	0
All I saw was a bunch of younger Inexperienced excuses for dentists .	0
let 's just say it and get it out there and then there 's no surprises at the cash register .	1
The server last night was rude and slow .	0
More than a month after I placed my order I received a vm to call them and was transferred to 3 different departments because they were saying they needed an authorization from my doctor ( NOT my insurance ) to place the order .	0
Ingrediants were very fresh .	1
Way to be the example for great service and a wonderful demeanor !	1

It 's large with the full Vegas experience under one roof if you are n't wanting to explore ... with multiple pools , a plethora of restaurants , the Michael Jackson show , other concerts , standard shopping , and , of course , a casino .	1
A couple minutes later another waiter comes up and says `` are you ready to order ?	0
I will never refer them to anyone and it 's their loss bc I work in an office full of women who were interested in getting facials as well .	0
She offered me coffee , tea , or a glass of Prosecco ( nice touch ! )	1
The rooms are very well maintained .	1
We also thought we would have to take down all the decor that we had provided but they took everything down and had it ready for us in the morning which was such a relief .	1
Delicious !	1

She then massaged my legs and feet for another 20 minutes or so , then asked me to flip over and massaged my back ( through a towel and my shirt ) fairly aggressively for the remainder of the time .	0
She was condescending in her tone , and the final numbers that I was going to be charged did n't add up , so it made me question her ; she said she 'd look into it , and mentioned that I 'd have to schedule my cleaning .	0
No acknowledgement by her , except for that the plate was hot .	0

It was lunch time and half of us wanted breakfast and the other half lunch , so a bagel shop was the perfect stop .	1

It 's fabulous !	1
We also ordered a side of chips and guac which at $ 3.75 was a steal .	1
There is an expediter at check in , quietly ensuring that the process is smooth and pleasant .	1
The manager was the person who stood in the background watching the whole situation , the waiter was completely uncomfortable but the manager was watching him as he continued to restate his claim that we will now be charged $ 2 per person .	0
We plan to return next yr to Vegas with friends for a show and I wo n't be returning to dine here again when I have other options .	0
Long story short , this can be a cool place when they are working hard but too often enough their service is deplorable .	0
This is a huge disappointment .	0
We all had full drinks we just reordered and had not paid our bills .	0
Great for the beautiful summer weather !	1

The steaks were undercooked ( how is that possible when we waited so long ? )	0

Love them !	1
I love their alcoholic beverage options and happy hour is always a winner !	1
Plus gave me a free screen protector !	1
It 's not some scam or miracle , It 's just the normal way all patients should be treated .	1
Their indoor key feature is that they have tall , huge screens in the background that emits colorful lights and imagery that goes along with the music .	1
I also like that they take extra good care of their players .	1
The potatoes and cauliflower ( aloo gobi ) also could stand to have less oil and many more fresh herbs and spices ( like turmeric , cumin and mustard seeds ) as well as fresh ginger .	0
Ca n't wait to visit again !	1
Employee ( Bev ) is taking order at counter .. She sneezes in her shirt which she grabs with her hand .. She says sorry .. Then she does it again .. Then she grabs donut to serve me .. NOT GOOD	0

I have to say that both my consultant and seamstress were quite unprofessional and made my wedding dress experience quite unpleasant .	0
I really wanted to like this place but sadly the dish I got was disappointing : ( I got the steak and eggs .	0

: )	1
It 's at 50/50 chance I wo n't come back to this one .	0
Their name is an outright lie .	0
The worst hotel experience ever !	0
They have an extensive drink menu though we stayed with their nice selection of wines .	1
Also , bring a granola bar & water , book !	1
The reason I gave 2 stars was because of the Groupon .	0
The burgers were mediocre , the fries were awful , and the onion rings were inedible .	0
We definitely wo n't be back .	0
How sad in todays world that companies can just tell you that you are responsible for charge without any evidence that you requested service or goods and then sticks it to you further by not having desire to refund .	0

She lied to us , took our money , and went out of her way to push other additional products such as life insurance at us .	0
I signed everything understanding exactly what it meant .	1
I would definitely stay here again For a good nights sleep and access to the old town sites .	1
I also decided to get some botox done and could n't be happier with the results .	1
* click * I have an email confirmation stating that my daughter 's appointment was at the desert ridge location AND had received a call back confirmation from them three days earlier ... this is not the way to treat customers- by blaming them for your own mistakes .	0
I tried to cancel my membership and they incented me by saying they would give me $ 150 LT bucks to use but then I never actually received them !	0
We contacted the customer service line and they said that the delivery service is subcontracted and they could n't do anything .	0

I called the spa and they had nothing available either earlier in the same day , or on any other day between that point and my wedding , so I asked to cancel .	0
Worst restaurant I 've ever been too , no customer service , food is ok , but customer service is the worst I 've ever experienced , stay away if you want to dine in .	0

I do not recommend them .	0
The front desk staff was incredibly rude , our roll away bed for one of our daughters that we paid for at 4 pm check in we did not receive until 9:30pm after I went back to the front desk to inquire !	0

The only downside is price - expect to pay over 20 dollars for a burger or salad .	1

After a 45 minute wait , I was told another 30 were required .	0
This place is just terrible .	0

Thank you !	1
I will NEVER go there again .	0
I was n't about to explain I have no intentions on coming back in front of this poor woman who just told me she loves what she does and has only been doing it for 2 years etc ..	0
I attempted to call again to no avail .	0
The girl told me `` everything you need is in there '' so I tipped them $ 10 , which was about a 25 % tip and when I get back to the office there is nothing in the bag other than our food .	0
This is also unsatisfactory .	0
Really hope management can get the rude too cool for school employees in check .... also I have never been compensated for waiting almost an hour for food .	0
The only good thing about this hotel is the overpriced restaurants .	0
Worst pizza and worst customer service from an Italian joint ever .	0
Nonetheless , it 's disappointing to see this kind of food waste just because the kitchen ca n't follow the food orders ( otherwise this would be a five star review ) .	1
All in all - It was the answer to my Cinco de Mayo prayers !	1
But I also know when a job is too large for me to handle on my own and have a pretty good idea of what to look for and recognizing poor quality work .	1
The towels were clean but the beds were horrible !	0
Thus can be argued as efficiency , or a lack thereof .	0

That 's why I give it 2 stars .	0
An amazing little place with so much originality .	1
Their holistic care is unparalleled & I am so happy I found them !	1
Our server a young lady was horrible .	0
I would have been embarrassed to claim to be the manager , when there were obviously many that were not being served while she was running around frazzled .	0
Great thing is that they let you sample any flavor before you buy so you leave with exactly what hits the spot .	1
You guys are awesome ! !	1
The minestrone came next and it was so flavorless and poorly cooked , I could n't have more than a couple spoonfuls .	0
Recliner cost over $ 1000 Aug 2017 and completely useless by Oct 2018 .	0
Also , the girl who sat us in was also very disinterested .	0

Very disappointing .	1
If only NEGATIVE stars were possible !	0
The service is very enthusiastic , eager to introduce most of the more `` interesting '' items on the menu .	1
All of us complaining had ordered take out and one man asked the question `` if we had come in and sat down would it take this long to get served '' The managers answer was `` no '' This of course set everyone off .	0
When I got in there , the lady at the front was so nice !	1
I had a fairly bad experience when I first signed up and got personal training , but I kept going after I received a refund .	1

I finally got it back when contacting my bank but this is a highly unprofessional and bad experience !	0
So while I know my puppy is the most loving and sweet boy , he will not be returning because no one apologized for his stomach pains and they blamed me .	0

I would n't recommend this salon unless you want your gel polish peeling off after 2 days .	0
The eel rolls were the worst offender in failing to live up to expectations .	0

A genoise sponge shell was filled with a four berry pudding and covered with a raspberry coulis and caster sugar .	1

These guys did great work - honest , no 'upsells ' , and got a great education about my own teeth along the way .	1

This was poor customer service .	0
Delicious !	1
The live entertainment was a great plus too .	1
I gave them a 4 star as they are as good as a dry cleaners can be .	1
They also have a lot of collectible stuff , books , games , purses ( really cute and cool ones ) , magnets , old Atari games and so much more .	1
I felt that was really unprofessional to seat your customers and have them expect to be served food only to be told never mind .	1
Probably one of the worst places to gamble at .	0
The older lady at the front was extremely rude and yelled at me when I nicely asked why they altered something I told them not to AND charged me for it .	0
She loved it .	1

all this fat guy kept repeating was bitch , stupid bitch , stupid bitch .	0
I ordered meatloaf and pork shoulder , the meatloaf was bland covered with no taste gravy , while the pork shoulder was decent .	0
Not even worth 1 star .	0
Unfortunately the coffees were charged incorrectly .	1
A couple of other `` Caribbean '' places I 've tried have an Indian twist to it , but this feels a lot more authentic Caribbean .	1
Absolutely inexcusable for a dealer 's professional technician to be 100 percent wrong about a simple oil leak .	0
It was n't dry or overcooked which was perfect !	1
Staff still personable .	1
The woman left claiming she 'll come back another time but had dinner plans for that evening , but I hope she does n't return , as I 'm assuming she wo n't .	0

A week ago Jessica agreed to refund me 50 dollars .	0
It 's perfect ever time !	1
Prices are very reasonable , and the interior is cool ; it looks like it has n't been updated since the restaurant 's 1972 opening .	1
That 's almost $ 600 in trade call fees for their company.They have refused to admit liability even though they have fired the employee who did the repairs .	0
Friday no one showed They promised a repair person first thing Monday .	0
It is sad to say , but I am was very frustrated that these three gentleman at Jiffy Lube would not take my business today .	0
DO NOT GO THERE AND WASTE YOUR MONEY .	0
4 dif flavs of chicken wings to choose from - their signature dry rub was probably the best !	1
After we placed an order it took very long for them to bring out the food to us and it was another waitress that brought out the food and I asked politely if she could bring me some chipotle sauce and she never came around to doing that .	0

WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE .	0
That said , I agree with Kimber Lanning that Devour had outgrown the Art Museum .	1
Time and time again I overheard staff declining guests requests .	1

Combined with beautiful summer weather and an incredible view , I really do n't need anything else .	1
Besides the totally disgusting food , the bill was like 18 bucks for the two of us , there were flies all over , and people were smoking just outside the entrance .	0
Total disappointment .	0

I will never go again .	0

It 's been a few weeks , so I ca n't remember what was in it exactly , but it was very flavorful , kind of like sweet pepper maybe ?	1
This was ridiculous , not planning on staying there again if they do n't fix that type of problem .	0
How unprofessional and cruel you have to be to behave like that ... Penningtons should re-think their hiring strategies , if Store Manager Assistant acts like that , what we as customers can expect from the staff ?	0
Total waste of money .	0
Ann location is the worst .	0

Perfection .	1
Disappointing , the chips will break your teeth , the guacamole was lacking any flavor .	0
I love hakka food !	1

Worst experience ever !	0
The deco and lighting in here were perfect .	1

Highly recommend especially if you 're a small group of people .	1
Do not support this business .	0
In one word .... horrible .	0
The chicken breast was cut into finger strips and the dish is served with a side of rice that compliments the curry perfectly .	1
Other than that this place rocks .	1
I have really painful and possibly infected cuticles due to the negligence of their manicurist .	0

They showed up on time for the move , which is the only good thing I can say about this company .	0
Amy is a true Broad , loved her history of the joint .	1
Service was super fast !	1
The bartender made us feel very unwelcome as he handed us only one food menu , no drink menu and then expected us to know what we were drinking without being able to see a drink list .	1
Thank you for caring for your costumers .	1
it took a few minutes to make , by one person and it was amazing .	1
Based on the reviews I 've read this place has gone seriously downhill .	0
There 's an almost palpable disdain for every customer that walks in and such a lackadaisical disregard for even pretending to care about their customer service jobs .	0
I would SO recommend this wonderful bakery to anyone wanting a special custom cake at a reasonable price .	1
If you like interesting and healthy , clean food , definitely check this place out with an open mind .	1

The staff very friendly and accommodating .	1

The hand wax moisturizing gloves were a great touch too .	1
My husband and I went to the West End Bistro on a Saturday night at 8:30 - they graciously squeezed us in - it is a cozy place and I liked the atmosphere of the bar and upstairs seating .	1
Such a smart move to bring in their great food !	1
The health department needs to take a really close look in these restaurant kitchens as to how the help is handling their personal hygiene when working with food served to the public .	0
This is a must date night	1
After tonight and how rude they all were I will never be returning to that H & M at the Forum Shops in Ceaser 's Palace ever again !	0
Waited for over 20 mins to get our bill and pay and of course with the size of our group the waiter automatically gets 18 % so he was not the least bit worried about the service and it was evident .	0
The one thing that stuck out to me about this place was that it has a very sleek and modern feel to it allot of hard wood everywhere and very little decorations making it feel very clean .	1
So tragic to see such poor training done with these people .	0
Im so happy this place is here !	1
Reasonable prices and good communication along the way .	1

The atmosphere is simple and clean , yet warm and comfortable .	1
2.5 Stars .	0
After a few bad hair cuts over the past couple of years ( at other salons ) , she has been the only person I 've been able to trust to cut my hair , and I will continue to go to her as long as I can .	1
Its a pleasant surprise of an explosion in your mouth !	1
Every time I 've been here drinks are made pretty quick and consistently .	1
I think I , along with most people , would be less upset if you just included the resort fees in the regular hotel price and stop treating people like they 're stupid .	0
I asked about the fee and she says debit card fee .	0
If I could I would give this business negative stars .	0
Do n't mess around - Just get the boozy ( Bailey 's ) espresso milkshake .	1
WORST PLACE TO TAKE FOR SERVICE !	0
We had to wait an inexcusable time to get our order taken and to get our check .	0
I got FOOD POISONING from this place ... and I nearly died 2 days later .	0
The dishes are a bit on the expensive side , but the food feels organic , fresh and healthy .	1

I went to Express with a group of friends and received the most ridiculous customer service ever .	0

One of the best in Pittsburgh ,	1
The only nice thing I really have to say about this restaurant was that when I walked in someone greeted me and said welcome to cicis pizza , however he did not have a smile on his face .	0
Definitely will not be back here .	0
He is seriously talented .	1
I walked out feeling like I did something wrong by asking a question about a shitty 50 dollar bottle of wine that we never even got back .	0
This place is great !	1
Not impressed .	0
The people that came after us was served before us and when we asked the waitress why she simply stated that it was because `` they had less people '' .	0

Their Pad Thai is soooo good ( especially so when paired with alcohol ?	1

From the mushy uncooked shrimp to the stickey and low quality crab legs to all the low quality cuts of meat .	0
so i continue to place my order for pick up which was the following : Crab jumping rice & thai pineapple chow mein w/shrimp and add beef which i was told was 3 dollars extra .	0
We grabbed a bite from another hotel and went back about 1 1/2 hours later hoping she would have a better attitude and we 'd get better service .	0
And everything I 've had there has been delicious !	0
Very disappointed .	0
A year later , while getting my oil changed , the owner 's son alerted dad that I needed over $ 1,000 worth of work on things they had supposedly done a year before .	0
Ultimately I did n't want to spend $ 15 for a salad or sandwich and not a single employee greeted me or asked if they could help so I walked away .	0
The chicken fingers are amazing !	1
We were warmly welcomed and ordered coffee , tea , and some pastries .	1

This is nice place to have morning meetings , a break for employees and patients.ABP employees are always more than helpful !	1
Their flavours are much bolder than fresh mushrooms , so people who like mushroom chicken steamed rice , or at least that type of palette , woudl like this options .	1
Went to Dianna 's for mother 's day and was not impressed .	0
He just stared at me as if I was ruining his day & looked like he did n't want to be there at all .	0

Seriously everything was amazing !	1
Definitely hit the spot .	1
Songs are fun !	1

I have been there a few times and i will certainly be back for more .	1
My friend had an eggs Benedict and said it was awesome too .	1
Two stars for beer , but no stars for service .	0

Please do n't waste your time or money on this very over-hyped steakhouse .	0
But when you get bad service and bad food well what is left ?	0

This was my first and last trip to Luci 's HEALTHY Marketplace .	0
So , I called them , and the girl on the phone sounded mortified .	1
This place has a lot of selections of food , toys , treats , and accessories !	1
Our server was also very attentive It 's also worth mentioning that Lee offers an equally epic cocktail menu .	1
He was a short mexican dude with the bro cut that totally didnt give af about customer service which is awful for branding .	0
MARK IS MAGICAL : with full balayage highlights , the aforementioned blah brown is now fabulously multi-dimensional with layers of amber , caramel , and honey .	1

Jennifer had called me to talk about another car , not even to apologize .	0
So worth the wait .	1
Luckily the manager came over refunded the entire check .	0

Never again !	0
Even short lines take forever to move and no one ever acknowledges me even though they see me standing and waiting for quite some time .	0
My pedicure is fine , but my gel mani looks awful .	0
I was not going to go again because I have already spent far too much time and gas going back and forth .	0
And yes I am going to say it ... I am looking forward to my next visit !	1
Very rude .	0
She proceeded to torture all the tables around ours with the same story .	0
And after all this , no tip ( of course ) , and no reimbursement offered .	0

Hits the spot for sure .	1
The service felt disorganized .	0
Even the garlic bread was just a bland tasting piece of buttered roll with some parsley sprinkled on it .	0
My favourite things on the menu are definitely the chicken shawarma wraps and the falafel ( I have n't had them in a wrap yet , but by themselves they are AMAZING ) , and they 're quite affordable too .	1
I always go with the thinnest round ones , I found they have the best chewy texture .	1
We despise your success to the dismay of seniors hoping for compassion and care .	0
The food tasted ok but definitely not worth the wait and the price .	0
Also their spring rolls are good too .	1
Rest seem like they could careless and take any ownership on this issue .	0

This place is clean , service is excellent , items are always fresh and waiting .	1
I left the restaurant after insisting I did n't receive my card back and the waiter had hardly bothered to check for me and insisted he already gave it to me .	0
Delicious .	1
patio is a great bonus and the $ 5 happy hour is awesome !	1
The have a very extensive menu with meals for everyone .	1
However , if you are a professional and looking for professional service , stay away from this place- the owner is not equipped to handle the pressure and there are many other companies out there that will do much better .	0
They seemed like high schoolers and quite frankly I know they were being lazy and that to me is very unprofessional and I will not recommend this place to anyone .	0
SCAMMERS !	0

We wo n't cancel your flight . ''	0
I called the office and the woman told me that this would be corrected by the billing department .	0
When it came out it was overdone too hot to eat and NOT overall good at all .	0
Nevertheless , the types of deals you 're able to get with a good eye make it more than worth it to stroll through now and then , even if you 're not looking for anything in particular .	1
Very great experience over all and will be back because of the service and atmosphere !	1
And to think I used to LOVE Chiasso ... A few weeks ago I went in and was served a terrible latte .	0
All in all it was a disappointing experience and we will not be back .	0
Horrible experience .	0
Having that been said let 's get down to business ... Before I slam these people let me discuss the positives .	0
DO NOT use this moving company .	0
Found this to be very inconvenient and unprofessional , especially since the rep stated that there was no opening for my appointment THAT WAS ALREADY SCHEDULED since she claims she 's unsure of how I was able to do it .	0
I also appreciate that the Drake One Fifty is committed to working with local providers .	1
Refreshing and different .	1
I had one of the oolong teas and my husband had the Brazilian coffee .	1
At this point we pointed out to her that pretty much every employee at Kay Jewelers had mislead us , and that if they had said that it would take an extra week from the get-go things probably would 've been fine- but absolutely none of them did .	0
I 've been going to Zets for about 6 years and I 'm never disappointed .	1
The provider then says `` What are you doing , that goes in the nose ? `` .	0
Thanks brittney for a job well done !	1
I 'd just like to say that this place is amazing !	1
I guess I 'm stuck using the month until I 'm done because clearly BodyHeat Tanning has no interest in keeping customers .	0
Good gym , very big and clean , with machines for almost everything possible and free classes .	1
Cobb salad was delicious .	1
Crawfish was $ 16.95/lbs which was little pricey for those who do n't eat ( since not much meat ) but as for us , it cured the crave ! !	1
They will refuse to listen .	0
We got the first time and dulce de coffee which were both delicious .	1
I was severely disappointed given the positive reviews from Yelp !	0
As I mentioned in my previous review , Maizie 's was my favorite spot with the first Urban Wine Walk .	1
As a manager she should 've been accommodating especially since we just spent close to $ 30 .	0
WOW~~I will say it again , there ARE ROACHES IN THE KITCHEN .	0
The staff are very attentive , friendly and especially the guy named Carson ( is that his name ? )	1
Eat everything blindfolded because everything tastes like love and will take you to Italy on your first bite , guaranteed .	1
28 or so ALL CRAFT BEERS On Tap .	1
Also note that the casino at this hotel caters to locals , which makes it a pretty pathetic place to walk through late at night .	1
The shrimp and grits were so delicious and the waffle was made to perfection !	1
The hostess was extremely rude when we walked in , and was distant and uninterested in our business .	0
Menu has a broad selection of breakfast and lunch options .	1
In other words , there is no customer service at Macy 's .	0
They refused to talk APRs and would only discuss payment amounts .	0
Each time the pizza was soggy and left me with awful heart burn .	0
I could n't even drive the vehicle with the visor hanging down blocking my rear view so I had to hold it up with one hand , and then had to tape it up so it would stay .	0
The pho is pretty good , love the decor of the restaurant !	1
Everyone there deeply cares about getting you feeling better .	1
You ca n't beat the price on craft beer and shots anywhere .	1
Then when the clerk came back to the register n walked rite by me not saying a word .	0
Wow this is truly one of the worst customer service experiences I have had .	0
Our service at a bar table was nonexistent .	0
Take the stairs after you eat you will be full !	1
This is just another mediocre at best Mexican hole in the wall attempting to make good food with cheap ingredients .	0
My favs : penne ala vodka and the eggplant parmesan .	1
Absolute perfection .	1
I found the food incredibly inedible .	0
A coincidence which I did n't care about since I felt violated and stalked down ..	0
You wo n't be dissappointed .	1
I 'm drinking my water and I look inside the cup and its filthy ! ! !	0
Such disgust .	0
I wo n't go back due to the fact that they have goofed 3 times out of 2 visits .	0
All very delicious .	1
Our waitress , I call her waitress because she failed to even give us her name , appeared agitated when we did n't order drinks , just water .	0
They let you take home as many large samples as you want .	1
Horrible customer service .	0
I 've been getting my nails done for many years and have been to many nail salons , and this is by far the worst I 've ever been to .	0

I had high hopes for V. Picasso .	0
I love this place , making people look great and feel great must run in this family 's blood .	1
They have a great selection and a helpful staff .	1
She then ran over to our waiter and pointed us out , the waiter brought our bill with the 2 drinks on the bill still and said dont worry I will take it off but he left the bill there .	0
Assuming it was normal I left him and walked around the facility for a good 20 minutes then later left .	0
I 'm never going back , I have such a bad opinion about this place .	0
The chicken was dry , and the sandwich as a whole was just meh .	0
Our food , which took about 30 minutes to arrive , was originally delivered to the wrong table , and when we did get it , was flavorless , bland and cool .	0
I got a youth smoothie , containing kale , Spinach , soy protein and peach !	1
Speaking to manager was useless .	0
The front desk clerk did nothing to help .	0
It 's the perfect spot for drinks/tacos before heading out to old town or for a romantic date .	1
The window in our room was screwed shut so we could n't have any fresh air .	0
Our server finally arrives with the credit card machine and we start working through the payments .	0
Quick , friendly service : )	1
Communication was awesome .	1
I wo n't be back .	0
try to get a quote from these guys called them sent the information never heard back .	0
Menu photos are deceptive .	0
When we offered to use my husband 's cc for payment , they refused .	0
There 's a sign so wall says `` no pissy attitudes '' .	0
It 's not just the cooks , but poor quality ingredients .	0
I waited for 2 hours and 40 minutes and came back to the store , expecting the glasses to be finished , only to be told I need to wait another 10 minutes .	0
The manager then told me well we said it would be done about 4:00 and the tires are not here yet .	0
Thank you Derick and the Credit Absolute Team !	1
My night began with a staff of unpleasant employees .	0

I will come again and hope the quality stays as good as this time .	1
Oh , and after two hours of waiting , she finally gets it laminated and just slams it onto the counter and says `` there you go '' and walks off .	0
I 'm hooked on the cowboy pizza and the cinnamon wheel !	1
What about that supposed phone call that she made , to some person who said it was ok to waive that fee for me ?	0
Very professional and efficient .	1
The decor is modern and quirky , but in a good way .	1
Then another 3-5 minutes passed by and someone came and got drink orders .	0
I wo n't go back .	0
Informative and knowledgeable in an aesthetic and mellow setting .	1
I finally decided it 's not worth it to come inside because of the stuff that goes on inside the lobby .	0
HEY IDIOT MANAGERS ! !	0
Byron has been very helpful and has answered all my questions .	1
After talking to the very unhelpful girl there , Kianna , I quickly realized they could care less about taking advantage of people .	0
Fantastic .	1
If that were to improve then it would get 5 stars .	1

WTF ?	1
Awards mean nothing to a patient in for care when you are confronted with this scornful bunch of snobs .	0

Let 's start off with the beer so I ordered an IPA they make and it 's was so good !	1
Staff is exceptionally pleasant , genuinely look engaged , and happy to help with any questions .	1
Despite the micro managing of the staff there are still common restaurant errors , wrong drink , messed up order , not cooked to order , missing item , the usual restaurant errors .	1
Everything is extremely fresh and the service is good too .	1
We always have leftovers for a midnight snack .	1
Move in went smoothly and the staff is really helpful .	1
Love this place for a quick lunch .	1
I will rate the two stars because of the atmosphere and food charm .	0
The spicy tuna roll is my standby because it is consistently delicious .	1

Horrible hotel .	0
I 've never seen a man in his 50 's say that and act that rudely .	0

she 's says yes. , it wasn't. , then when I returned it she did n't toast the bread so needless to say it went down tough but I just was not going to go back up there again ...	0
This coming from an Asian knowing how bad Asian service already is and this is worst .	0
It was overpriced and not worth it .	0
I mean shitty ... it was horrible crappy shit .	0
It amazes me how poor the customer service is .	0
They offered wireless internet / wifi , but the connection was so weak and slow that it was n't worth connecting to .	0
She and Ms. Katie helped me recently with my cat 's visit and I am so grateful to them .	1
The prices are a bit high for the area but honestly our dinner tonight was worth every penny .	1
I loved the fries they were the right amount of crunchiness !	1
I asked to speak to a manager and some young kid said he was the manager .	0
Definitely worth the cost .	1
To add insult to injury my car was broken into .	0
After I paid for my food I waited almost 20 more minutes or another way to put it about 30 minutes after it was suppose to be ready .	0
I used to do my coin-op laundry here before moving to a new apartment , and while it was a bit more expensive than other places , the facility was kept clean and the equipment worked well , saving me time and money in the end .	1
The ravioli with balsamic drizzle were delicious .	1
I asked for a box , and that took another ten minutes .	0
WTF ?	0

Fantastic sandwich .	1
Absolutely in love with this little corner of heaven in Cleveland .	1
In fact , the girl helping me asked an older lady about the order and she kind of shrugged with a `` too bad '' attitude and said they 're too busy .	1
If I could rate this place a zero star I would .	0
Absolute garbage .	0
She was very rough with him during the exam and made no attempt to calm him down while she checked him .	0
Sliders are top notch , hot dogs are great , and probably the best milkshake I 've ever had .	1
I would n't go back here .	0
I will definitely be returning when I find that there is not a huge line !	1
Once I stood in the business line for 10 mins , while the regular line filled up with other customers , THEN they tell me there was no business teller that day .	0
Although some employees are not understandable while conversing , they 're very friendly and help whenever they can .	1
I 've been here numerous times and never had any issues in fact I like the place and tell my friends to go here all the time but after this experience I will NOT be coming back .	0
Many times they have such great deals on fruit which I ca n't pass up , even if I do n't particularly need it .	1
Thank you Tami ! !	1
Regardless of the time issues , when I got back to my hotel I had to get silverware because they do n't give to go silverware .	0

I had a tasty tasty Delux hamburger ! !	1
The fried portion was crispy and chewy and had great flavor .	1
One of my favorites is the Hangar steak and I 'm not normally a steak eater .	1
The on-site management team is simply trying to make it through another day until they can find another job elsewhere .	0
so good !	1
Hop , Drop & Roll still great , though I did learn not to pop a vanillaburst mint in my mouth after having an IPA with my meal ! )	1
Out of all the tapas dishes you can choose from , the top 3 are the bacon wrapped dates , stuffed peppers , and the kobe beef sliders !	1
The only good thing was that we had a very nice waiter but otherwise , the ambience of the restaurant is just OK. We will not be returning .	0
I will definitely do the 50 lap next time to be able to get to the Advanced Racing Experience my ultimate goal .	1
* Fried green beans : my friends ' favorite .	1
the price is about the same as the house of prime rib , expect to spend about $ 100 for dinner for two , more if you have dessert and wine , but the service and quality is well worth the money .	1
Will NEVER return	0
The `` manager '' was defensive and irritated while listening to our concerns and fed us a line of excuses like `` I 'm new '' ...	0

Well we waited another 28 minutes exactly before calling back at 6:29pm to get the status again .	0
We were at a conference at PH and stumbled upon this place for lunch on 3/5 .	1
No sorry , no manager to assist when I asked for one , just gave me a number for me to call .	0
I have tried a few of their meals and all were very delicious .	1
Because he was honest about the time schedule , I was able to occupy my time at the shopping center near by instead of waiting in the store .	1
I gave them a nice tip but THEY ABSOLUTELY LOST MY BUSINESS ! ! !	0
Every question we asked was met with a shrug or unhelpful answer .	1
But the critical error for me , and for that they lose 2 stars , is the math error in the bill .	0
There is a small but nice patio outside so you can sit and people watch .	1
You will not be disappointed .	1
The letter are hard to press , and at times it would just not respond .	0
This is my favorite place to see a movie .	1

Very , very large portions and very satisfying .	1
The overall experience was wonderful .	1
They wanted to escort my friend out because some loser drunk idiot was trying to fight with her because she turned him down .	0
I am appalled at the lack of concern .	0
I loved this place , it was so bright and airy , that I cant wait to make reservations and try their dinner menu one day , hopefully soon !	1
He was incredibly rude and my dad and I along with many others left before even getting inside because the man at the door was so rude .	0
Guess they are both too busy replying to bad reviews and trying to explain their `` business policies '' .	0
She was very knowledgeable and I really enjoyed the beer I landed on .	1
I was begging her to help me try to use the coupon one more time , and she refused to help me again because the system does n't show up the coupon , and she also asked me to `` step away '' from the cashier .	0
If simply carrying the Kroeger brand and giving me moving boxes does n't justify 5 stars , the selection and value are also excellent , and as someone else mentioned , it never gets too crowded .	1
Lunch today was very enjoyable .	1
I mean the food is not terrible .	0
The custard is way better than ice cream .	1
Why bother telling you this ?	1
Terrible servicio .	0
I went a while back after boycotting `` Shart '' Club for over a year ( for the poor service and badly cooked food ) ... and unfortunately they confirmed that the service was still horrible ! ! !	0
The atmosphere is local style and music is on point .	1

I am extremely disappointed especially knowing the owner of the bar is in the band .	0
I have never encountered so many rude employees .	0
I asked if the additional testing would be covered by AETNA the office says yes .	0
Most of the staff were friendly though the cashier had difficulty and there was a young man wearing an `` in training '' name tag who looked absolutely miserable and did n't return my `` hello '' .	0
In one of the rooms there was a COCKROACH ! ! ! !	0
Showed up towards the end ( 30 min til the class was over on a Saturday night ) and we were asked to leave being told that they did n't allow `` observers '' .	0
Wookie is normally who I work with , but all the staff here are nice , professional and knowledgeable .	1
We were too stuffed for dessert but the options definitely looked yummy !	1

The layout and screen placements are great for viewing your favorite team .	1
At a cost of $ 8.34/- , this gyro lunch was , and no exaggeration , the worst I have ever come across .	0
The food was mediocre at best .	0
This is the worst dining experience I 've ever experienced in all my years .	0
Obviously very dishonest .	0
To be honest AT & T itself has gone downhill .	0

This ordeal was a complete waste of time not to mention a ding on my credit for an inquiry .	0
I would not go back .	0
WTF ?	0

Great location !	1
Worst experience ever !	0
I love this place .	1
It 's never too busy and I always enjoy my movie time here !	1
The Asian salad is an amazing entrée .	1
A small unassuming diner located in the middle of nowhere-BoulderCity , where burgers & sandwiches are still fashioned in the ways of old & service makes no compromise of treating you right .	1
He never came back to pickup our ticket and credit card , so I pulled out exact cash and coins and we left .	0
I also had the blueberry pie and toffee cookie ; they were absolutely heavenly !	1
We were sorely disappointed and can not in good faith recommend this restaurant to anyone .	0
This is quickly becoming a favorite restaurant of mine .	1
The large open room and beer hall look with communal tables are great .	0
Yes there is crowds especially during holiday weekends .	1
However , we will not be back .	0

very upset about what happened	0
Warm , gooey and when you looked under the hood , the combination of beans and cheese living in bliss ( and soon my belly ) was a heavenly sight .	1

The pool is located right next to the Eiffel Tower so seeing it up close was pretty grand .	1
I wish I could give 10 stars !	1
Do n't want to spoil anything but the movie was fantastic and so was the theatre we watched it in .	1
Taste was okay , the texture of the chicken however tasted like it was hacked by a blind woodsmen with a very dull knife .	0
She just told us they did n't do brunch and then stared silently at us until we got up and left .	0
I will continue to come here and I recommend everyone try this place .	1
Completely unacceptable .	0
The next day nobody showed up ... the phone calls were not returned for 4 days and finally we were advised that the owner decided to cancel the job because he did n't want to do tile bead blasting .	0
The female employee had major attitude issues ( AKA bitchyness ) and the Manager lost his patience after the first few sentences .	0
Really disappointed .	0
It comes with a heaping portion of Gyro meat and the best greek dressing I 've had to date .	1
DO NOT USE THIS CAB COMPANY !	0
BUT now with the new management as of late 2014 , you 'll wish you have never signed that contract .	0
Ps lol taco bell called mexican food is false advertisement	0
So very disappointing .	0

If you are going to have a cup of coffee , you might as well have it in a classy environment like this ! !	1
You have your favourites that you flip to first , then your few blocks of channels that are usually decent and then the rest that you flip through JUST in case they have somehow got the rights to a show you actually like .	1
Stopped here on a road trip and wished we lived closer !	1
I 'm very disappointed with a recent experience I had with this company .	0
They do not check out the alleged violation prior to sending communication out to the resident .	0
I figured I would try this location and it did not disappoint !	1
Since we knew we probably would n't be back for another year , we went all out -- oxtail chili cheese fries and pork belly buns to share , and I went for the shogun burger since it has foie gras and it 's banned in California .	1
However , the maintenance for their pieces is terrible .	0
The mac & cheese is like a taste of heaven .... cheesy , gooey and creamy elbow macaroni with a crispy top .	1
I wish yelp would let me give them 0 stars .	0
I am also a fan of their combo plates and dinners , given they are the traditional selection of basic dishes but they are very affordable and come in a fair size portion too .	1
Overall , I would not be going back here again whether it 's summerlicious or a normal night out !	0
If there an option for -5 star , then this business deserve it .	0
I ordered up a slice and it was absolutely divine .	1
It 's not a melt in your mouth salmon but it 's one that is really good .	1
Clean , modern and a definite place to recommend .	1
Absolutely terrible experience , so sorry that I did not check yelp , before I got ripped off by this service .	0
The service was exceptional , the food was unbelievable and the drinks were original .	1
THEN When getting the check again she ignored me but when my boyfriend just raised his hand it was instantly `` Yes Sir , no Sir '' .	0
so they want you to have the hibachi , which was tasteless .	0
Keep up the good work , Israel and Elliot- I 'll definitely be back !	1
It was n't a long wait for the food , and the portion size was perfect .	1
The mild beef bulgogi noodles have a sweet teriyaki-ish taste and a perfectly soft , chewy texture .	1
Apparently she never told anyone she seated us .	0
They closed my account due to fraud from someone else ( this part I can understand ) however they would not release my funds to me and misinformed me about the process as to how I was getting my funds .	0
2.5 stars .	0
I bought CACAO MINT thinking that it would be perfect flavor for a day of ladies baking Christmas cookies .	0
New owner keeps us coming back .	1
I immediately called back and spoke to a very nice guy Ron who told me that his boss was n't there but he agreed it was unacceptable and said if I was willing to not eat it he could make it again and send it back out .	0
All were dry , looked old and just had bad flavor .	0
I did n't send the pathetic plate back because I was on a date and did n't want to seem disagreeable .	0
The breakfast enchiladas are my favorite .	1
It 's a sports fanatics dream wrapped in chicken wings and beer : D I am not the biggest sports fan , and every channel was tuned to a different sporting event .	1
It is tart and has a great texture .	1
The mussels were great - perfectly prepared , all the mussels were opened and came with delicious toasted bread .	1
BUT and this is a big BUT , my brother and I got a major case of food poisoning from eating a semi cooked oyster appetizer there , which all but ruined the last night of my bachelor party in vegas .	0
As the least likely person on earth to take a pilates class Anna 's enthusiasm , detailed instruction and cheekiness make you want to come back for more ab curls and planks .	1
Then we waited 45 mins to get our food only to find out that I was horrible .	0
We waited another 5 minutes & I saw only 1 server running around .	0
Nice selection of fruit on top , a drizzle of honey and bee pollen , which is excellent to consume if you suffer from seasonal allergies .	1
I have now had the displeasure of staying on two properties managed by this pathetic company .	0
He was exceptionally detailed when discussing the estimate and also told me what could be charged if the move required additional trucks , supplies , time etc .	1
They refused .	0
Crispy , a bit greasy , and had generous amounts of rosemary sprinklings .	1
So I found enough varieties of food that suites my taste so I like this buffet and would go there again .	1
I tried different stuff my favorite was the Thyme one it was awesome I would definitely go back to eat it .	1
Horrible !	0
Instead of offering us those wings for FREE , the man at the counter says he can wake another 15-20 minutes for bone-in wings or take the boneless ( yes as I said pay for them ) .	0
I 've been very impressed with their cocktails recently too , very well crafted !	1
Cleanest gym I 've ever been to .	1

Service : So dirt dogs has a cashier and a table service to deliver the food other than that there is not much employee customer interaction .	1
I figured it would be reasonable to ask for a refund for the classes I did n't use ( which is 4 classes but only $ 30 ) , but they 've said they do n't offer refunds .	0

Their policies defend their employees and allow them to lie to their customers ( me being told I can get out of it no problem ) hoping we do n't read the fine print .	0
Ca n't wait to go back !	1
Probably a good idea to make a reservation , they 're always super busy !	1
Even though there were a few birthday parties going at the same time the facility is big enough that it does n't feel overcrowded or stuffy .	1

Not going back price to high for poor food .	0

It is not just for kids but have fun and challenging classes for adults too .	1
I knew exactly what i wanted !	0
The waiters and waitresses are super friendly and helpful when it comes to giving recommendations and taking orders , but I really think they could make small changes here and there to make their service more efficient .	1
Would definitely go back for renewal .	1
- The capers , anchovies , black and cheese-less pizza was underwhelming and too salty -the featured salami , basil and cheese with a maple glaze was amazing !	1
I made multiple annoying calls asking many questions .	1
When I also called for the check , I said excuse me nice and clear twice but they continued to ignore me and my friend had to walk up to the counter to pay .	0

I was incredibly disappointed with this apartment complex .	0
Did n't get an apology either time .	0
All in all , if you want a good brat and it 's not crazy crowded yet , go here ( I prefer the white brats with REAL mustard lol ) .	0
The absolute worst person I 've ever met .	0
Never got a reply , then I call back and was told he was busy so I leave my information for call back and email , still nothing .	1
I would recommend this place , and would go back again because , PORK BELLY BAOS .	1
Worse customer experience ever .	0
I 've been to many Indian restaurants and this is one of my favorites .	1
If they can not make special hrs for the vendors or start testing the customers w/one or two items just like they do the vendors then maybe they should not be open to the public .	0
Still , I 'll probably go back for coffee because theirs really is a gorgeous space , but probably wo n't have a smoothie here again .	0
Otherwise , it 's gone downhill and it 's not worth it .	0

This is by far the best Authentic Mexican Food in the Las Vegas Area !	1
For some reason , we stayed and the host did apologize for the wait when he finally seated us -- but not for being unfair and likely dishonest about calling us .	0
With that being said .... we went in and there was no hostess was told by the bartender `` sit anywhere .... find an open seat ! ''	0
Would definitely eat it again .	1
The worst part of my meal was the cheese they put inside my omelet was definitely a Kraft single .	0

I was n't looking for a refund or freebie , but he did n't even offer one , just denied all accountability when I was just trying to let them know about the issues to prevent it from happening to someone else .	0
I was not even acknowledged after several minutes ( due to the argument ) and then the employee went off in a huff to the back .	0
Thank you !	1
There is a nice floral section as well as meat and deli .	1
I asked to speak with the manager , but he was a coward and would only speak through the cashier .	0

This place is great .	1
So I just decided to leave at this point because there was obviously no sense in talking to anyone there .	0

they were very accomodating .	1
We told her we heard our phone beep and flashed off our phone while we were on hold with them and no one answered .	0

Plus they have some homemade sodas on tap .	1
I wo n't be returning here or suggesting this place .	0
Her attitude was bad , she treated the customer poorly , and made fun of them .	0
If I could give separate ratings for each department , Mick and Scott would get 5 stars , however that is not possible , and since I had such a horrible experience with Jason , I am forced to give this rating 1 star .	0

Luis Burgos was a great , no-nonsense salesman who was very knowledgeable about the car and mindful of my time .	1
Consider joining them between 5 & 7 for their amazing 50 % steaks and selected items on their menu .	1
And a knowledgeable and personable server , Daniel .	1
Here , a lot of pointing out some really boring crap .	0
Being at JoBot , you can easily have the feeling that you are on vacation somewhere really cool , and this is one of those places that you only wish you had back in your hometown .	1

Food here is great !	1
Very close to Hawaiian poke if you order the pre marinated `` house '' tuna poke .	1

Will NOT go back .	0
But now I have come to find out that most of the plants do not even have proper irrigation running to them ( hence why they look so bad already ) .	0
The worst part ?	0
The website should be modified if they are unwilling to do parties between 16-49 people so that other patrons are n't mislead and do n't waste their time attempting to book or plan a party .	0
But still , they should have notified me about it so then I had to order 2 more del beef burritos which is the 2 for 5 .	0

Wow this place has really gone downhill since I moved here back in 2006 .	0
The only reason I did n't give this place 5 stars is because of the girl working there .	1
Perhaps one of the best Korean spots in Montreal after all .	1

THE KID 'S CLUB : horrible ! ! ! !	0
Go and check it out !	1
The employees are super chill and very inviting .	1
I 've never heard of pasta being topped with blue cheese , but I fell in love with it !	1

Wo n't be coming back .	0
But much lighter , not heavy at all , just delicious and what you could call a gourmet Big Mac sauce .	1
Minus one star because they 're not the cheapest place you can go to .	1

The staff is very friendly as well .	1
Everyone on staff were very attentive , including Hem , the owner , who visited every table throughout the night and personally insured everyone was happy and enjoying themselves .	1
A bit on the pricy side , but considering everything is from scratch I find myself going back again and again .	1
She did n't offer any apologies for her absenteeism but was at least semi-polite during the two second checkout process .	0

Krista the manager She is very mean and dismissive while treating her customers as incompetent pet owners if they do n't know what she knows .	0
about 45 dollars a person , however we had a large party of 7 and someone out front of the restaurant hooked us up with a coupon so everyone was able to get $ 6 dollars off their meal .	1
It was unnecessarily fatty ( chewy white parts ) , it did n't taste that fresh ( no taste of ocean : ( ) and I felt like the added soy sauce just masked the tastelessness of the salmon even more .	1
After a few minutes of insisting their computer was wrong , an employee wandered back to check .	0

The bento box was also quite large , served with plenty of bulgogi beef along with Korean sushi roll .	1
My wife ordered the Sweet Corn soup and we all had a taste ( she 's vegetarian ) , and it was fantastic , possibly the best corn based soup I 've ever had .	1

60 min massage : I thought this was the only redeeming part of the day until the next day I woke up with deep shoulder pain which developed into crunching during moderate exercise .	0

Great little hidden gem .	1
Also , be aware that the first floor of that blue house is absolutely atrocious .	1
We sat down and pretty much was ignored by the bartender .	0

Very disappointed with all the hype .	0
Wow I have never seen so much money tossed around and the result such shitty product .. okay maybe once or twice a year in Hollywood !	0

UPDATE : I received a call from Greg at Goettl today extending an apology for the nonexistent service we received .	0
I was not impressed with my entree , it lacked flavor .	1

Although several of the things I ordered here tasted different from my expectations , overall I think the chef knows what he 's doing and the meals have a good flavor .	1

I was furious , how can a restaurant be so negligant in not including something like that ?	0
They serve the BEST VEGAN FISH TACOS !	1
First , I thought this was absolutely ridiculous to not be able to make a quesadilla and secondly I felt they should have called to inform us before we waited and walked down , because after 30 minutes we had to reorder and wait again .	0
This was my second time visiting this restaurant and once again it was an amazing meal .	1

We then asked for the manager who also told us no !	0
I should have taken that as a warning sign but I gave Dwayne and his company the benefit of the doubt .	0
I will still not pay a bill for a service that I think should have been handled differently .	0
And then the glorious meat parade began .	1
We 've definitely played here when our kids were younger and had a blast ( with a parent having to climb through with the littles ) , but for birthday parties I think 6+ is the ideal age .	1
I got ta give the night shift gentleman his kudos ... he 's pretty great as well .	1
This lady by the name of GAIL : terrible service !	0
Then when I call them back they act like I never placed an order .	0

Their rates are fair and the work is outstanding .	1
The prices were super affordable !	1
The team is always smiling and attentive to the customer .	1

This one star is for the BULLSHIT SECURITY SYSTEM of this place .	0
There is a balanced mixture of fun , experimental new flavorings to try as well as classic drinks and teas , smoothies , etc .	1
I usually opt for the specials because they are unique and not seen on the menu .	1

Service was non existent , we went the whole meal without the waters we asked for 3 times .. waiter was Mia the whole meal .. the order of the food was even screwed up .	0
I am not exagerrating , it was perfectly made and filled with goats cheese and beans , it was just like some of the salads I had in Paris , Madrid and Rome !	1

The guy continued and all this was occurring right in front of the manager who proceeded to do nothing .	0
The prime rib was a little overcooked for medium but it was still tender and juicy .	1

The sangria was the worst I ever had .	0
While the food was acceptable for quiznos , meaning it did in fact cease the hunger , while still remaining completely average , the fascists that work there denied my special requests .	0
I personally think it is unprofessional to have a toddler wandering around the salon .	0
Aggressive and rude drivers .	0

I went up to purchase a soda to replace it , told the cashier about it and was not offered a replacement .	0
It was my first time visiting the wash and I wo n't be going back .	0
The worst part was just how rude management was , and the fact that the owners were hiding inside not dealing with the hundreds of angry/disappointed patrons .	0
This was terrible experience we wanted to get donuts and it began into a argument-between which donut I ordered and which one the worker wanted to give me , and when we first got our donuts they were thrown in a bag with napkins crumbled up .	0

The brisket is amazingly good .	1
The manager is super rude when I called ( not wanting a different one or a refund ) but just to inform them so people do n't get sick .	0
Conclusion : never again .	0
Instead of the $ 400 plus tab here we should have just went to Denny 's and then spent the rest on what ever the worst odd 's gaming was available .	0

I asked for it to be toasted and when the MOD came back , he said he did n't like my attitude .	0

They will always have a customer in me as long as they continue to provide good food , nice portions , and fair prices .	1
You get a big fat zero because Trish who answered the phone made me feel as if I was wasting her time by asking questions about taking an appt and being able to call and cancel if another dr got my son who has a broken wrist in sooner !	0
They only want your money and do n't care about keeping customers happy .	0
I went back to him told him that was UNACCEPTABLE and he went back to the young lady and told her to remove the `` resort fee '' of sixteen dollars and some change PER DAY for less than 1.0 MPS internet service .	0

Pretty horrible customer service .. if you 're unsatisfied with something in your own personal life do not take it out on the customer I asked the girl a question of something on the menu she was claiming as being unavailable .	0

Now , the three of us that were there all work or have worked as servers , so we know what it 's like when you 're slammed , but this guy was just blatantly ignoring us for an unknown reason and it was honestly disrespectful and unfair .	0
I emailed the manager and urged him to check on what went wrong to ensure that it does n't happen again - that was a month ago now ... after two follow-ups , still no response .	0
I eventually canceled my order because everybody was almost done with their food already .	0
She leaves for 10 minutes with my ID and says `` oh , the manager says we do n't have a truck for that price . ''	0

Must say it was a great experience and we would not hesitate to go back SOON !	1
I decided on a pan pizza with traditional sauce , roasted red peppers , fresh basil , fresh tomatoes , and red onions .	0
Later after seeing a pic of the Red Sox logo B she placed on my calf , it looked horrible .	0
Pittsburgh is an awful small town for such a big city , certainly I ca n't be the only one wishing those demons would stay somewhere far away from my brunch table ?	0
Worst $ 60 meal I 've ever had .	0
This location can be tricky during lunch and dinner time because there is limited parking in the Brixx lot and sometimes you have to park over in the shopping center next door and walk over .	1
Daniel is extremely friendly , professional , and organized - you can tell he truly cares about finding the perfect home for his clients .	1
Always checked in with me making sure I loved everything , & I did !	1
And quite simply put , not worth it .	0
Then when I ask for the manager ( Caren ) comes over replaces my sandwich with a new one which was great but then precedes to disappear and I get my check and still full price no compensation for all of the issues .	0
We honestly thought it was the worst Burlesque show we 've ever seen .	0

She had no reason behave the way she did , I was n't difficult with her - I tried to work with her but I will be contacting her manager , I 'm a supervisor and I would never tolerate my employees behaving in such an unprofessional manner .	0
1 Star because he seems like a nice guy who was willing to help my family out in a difficult situation , however he never returned our phone calls or picked up the car when requested & we gave him several days to do so .	0
Overall a satisfying experience that played on the taste-buds .	1

This is my second time to dine in Opus , again excellent service and high quality of food and wine does not disappoint me !	1
No one taking tickets at the entrance ( had purchased online and printed ) had to ask employee that acted highly disturbed to speak to a customer which theater .	0
Instead , she rudely told me that there probably were n't any that would be open , that their store had the most extensive hours in the city vs. other florists and besides that the mortuary would not accept delivery on Sundays .	0
Food tastes days old ... person taking our order had a horrible attitude .	0
They clearly do not care for the safety of their patrons .	0

I could have probably made better nachos at home , and I can barely cook .	0
After eating there last night for a date night I , we were extremely disappointed .	0
No accommodation was offered and I was rudely told that the groupon states it 's for first time clients only .	0

NEVER AGAIN !	0
My friend ordered biriyani and Saag chicken it was n't good either ! !	0
4 stars only because I think the prices per portion are out of line high ... especially the bar !	1
A great place to take friends and family if you want to impress !	1
When ordering the Kool Aid , I usually order it as half water , half Kool Aid as to not slip into a diabetic coma .	1
Tried the restaurant due to purchase of a Groupon -- was n't worth the money I paid for the Groupon .	0
Two stars to be kind to a local business with an apparently small staff and another piece of paper stuck to window advertising `` help wanted '' for the lunch hours .	0

Excellent Sunday brunch option ( Closed on Saturday 's ) .	1
It was alright but understandably stale .	1
Take your chances at this store , but I wo n't be going back .	0
They were unwilling to change the codes even though it would cost them nothing .	0
Wow this place has really gone down hill .	0
Very fresh tasting food .	1
Also , our server was terrible , rude , never checked back and again it took almost an hour to get food from the time we ordered .	0
The menu is a little different , but it forced me to go outside of my comfort zone and try something new .	1
This one was too salty , the egg was dry and tasteless .	0
I wo n't be visiting again .	0
Waited 45 minutes for our reservation even though other tables sat unoccupied waiting for large groups .	0

This in my opinion was unacceptable .	0
They continued to chug straight vodka from full glasses and after seeing that I had spoken to the manager started threatening to punch me and everyone else in the face and stood up and made fun of my disability publicly .	0
The park was jammed with people enjoying the warmth of the hot summer night and good music .	1
Any business that blatantly tells you they do n't care about your business has no value in their customers at all so why would anyone trust them with their money and lives by purchasing a used vehicle at this place !	0
Also puzzled when we asked to be seated outside-3 empty tables out there and were told we 'd need to wait 10 minutes for a table out there .	1
The meat was sooo chewy and nothing special about the flavor worth mentioning .	0
The peppercorn filet mignon is super tender and mine was cooked exactly to spec for the medium rare I ordered .	1
Definitely wo n't be back !	0
claimed we order things that no one from our table ordered .	0
If you 're looking for amazing Italian food items Milano is your heaven .	1
We received a complimentary bottle of champagne on ice from the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess with a card congratulating us on our anniversary !	1

When she finally made it , she put it on the top of the glass case and turned back to ignoring us again .	0
A short distance from CMU and U Pitt , this restaurant is a good place to go for inexpensive Chinese food .	1
One of the BEST photographers I have ever worked with .	1
I want to preface this review by saying that the pupusas here are delicious .	0
He told her that yes ... one , maybe even two would ( LOL ) and she responds with `` They are all fat and ugly ... why would you want that ? ? ''	1
It means something when I call this the single worst restaurant in Vegas .	0
I waited for an hour ... nothing .	0
It was such a great change from my Starbucks routine !	1
: - ) haha	1
I usually get the veal Parmigiano or greek pizza or Gnocchi .. actually my favorite is the spinach Gnocchi .	1
( Mishap # 5 ) Shortly after this , half the pasta courses made it to the table along with the manger who proceeded to argue with us over excuses for their mess up instead of just admitting the mistake .	0
And I could have gotten three great , fresh rolls at any other sushi place in town for what I paid to have an awful , dry , mishmash of garbage at this place .	0
We will be back !	1
It was funny We asked for the manager and the manager tried to send the waitress to speak with us ...... ah no I 'm sorry We asked for the manager not for the waitress that ignored us the whole time .	0
Baked pickerel was my fave , then the pastor .	1

TL : dr terrible food .	0
Basically deliciousness in my mouth !	1
After looking around , we left , I would not waste my time here .	0
Very reasonably priced !	1
Never again .	0
Not sure what went wrong there , but I can say the lamb was a rubbery mess that was hardly edible and something I really should 've sent back to the kitchen .	0
Nevertheless we both gave it the thumbs up ( my friend is a professional chef ) .	1
It was an interesting idea that was not executed well at all .	1
They did n't seem to care and did not offer any solution or compensation .	0
I do n't write to bash the place , which is why I listed what we ate- perhaps we chose poorly .	0
He finally forced himself to puke later in the night and felt and look way better .	0
I am from Pittsburgh originally and LOVE going there when I come for the weekends .	0
This restaurant if i could give it 0 .	0
The service here is absolutely terrible .	0
After 30mins , things got from bad to worse as we entered we were not greeted , nor walked to our booths , but rather a lot of miscommunication with the guest lists servers that were out there .	0
The wait staff are so friendly .	1
Again , be open minded and kind and you can have a great time scouring .. : )	1
To top everything off , the food was soggy and a waste of 30 $ .	0
Tha wings are good , but the employees are morons !	0
Support this fantastic small business where service truly is fantastic !	1
This place is legit as my wife would like to say .	1
BUT coming back from ATL the `` helpers '' where extremely rude !	0
There is also a beautiful patio to eat on that is right under the waterfall .	1
do n't think I will ever go back due to her behavior .	0
At that point , I decided that this type of company does n't deserve another penny of our money .	0
Once I saw the ahjumma visibly arguing with a couple and refusing to refill their banchan , which I thought was unusually petty when compared to other Korean restaurants , and counterintuitive to developing a loyal customer base .	0
Total bait and switch going on with this company ... read the other reviews and you will see it is a common practice .	0
Malyssa is worth 2of the 4 stars ! ! !	1
DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS STORE .	0
Simply made and very filling .	1

Gross .	0
Bunch of idiots .	0
The lady that owns this place is super unprofessional ! ! !	0
They are also very happy to give recommendations .	1

We made the arrogant bartender/manager know & his response was `` the ticket said medium not medium rare '' to which I responded that it was much more then medium too .	0
The egg was so flavorful , the curry soup was well balanced , wonderful curry flavor with a little kick to it but not too spicy .	1

My husband and I had a wonderful time at this Olive Garden our server Jamie was so polite and fast ! !	1

This is a great restaurant with a really nice atmosphere and staff , the open kitchen allows you to see how hard the chef staff works .	1
When I ask about my order I am told they ran out of chicken and it will be another 19 minutes to cook .	0
Even though , the agreement was to serve the drinks throughout the party , I saw him w walking around and eating my food and putting his filthy fingers in my cake .	0

Perfectly cooked and delicious !	1
Their queso is the best I 've ever had .	1
This is due to management laziness .	0
Also , the last time I came here , the receptionist said I owed $ 7.99 for my copay and that 's it , which I paid .	0
Even if you ca n't help a customer you should notify the customer that 's called customer service but apparently this dealership does n't have any of that .	0
The doctor then says , aggressively , why did n't you take it ?	0
The quality was terrible , it was n't fresh , the wasabe was enough for 2 slices and the ginger was white and dry .	0
Simply rude I 'm never going back and I was n't going to write a review because I never want to stop anyone 's blessing but I have lost 3 braids and I 'm on vacation pissed .	0

I defiantly recommend it or their salads !	1
- overall the pool has potential , but you need to be able to ignore the rather hostile environment and a jungle of unclear rules to make it work , be prepared that it might not be relaxing .	0
An hour before we were supposed to go I started reading reviews and they were very dismal .	1
The gyro rice bowl is out of this world with the rice , Israeli salad , gyro meat & tasty tzaziki sauce !	1

So the nightmare continues dealing with these people .	0
I also enjoyed my 2010 Graff Riesling .	1
Rooms are clean and have been upgraded , casino floor is lively and fun and the food ... a wide selection of restaurants to choose from .	1
The cabbage , white rice and plantains are always a must as well .	1
Place looks nasty .	0
With no one returning my calls , I have to come to a conclusion .	0
My Philly was the 2nd worst one I 've ever eaten ( coincidentally the worst is right behind it at Prima Pizza ) , and I 've had Cheese Steaks from easily over 100 restaurants and bars .	0
Over priced yuck !	0
This is a long overdue review !	1
Sigh ... maybe I 'll give this place another shot when/if I have extra money ... or not .	0

The food is very healthy , but so incredibly tasty .	1
They are also very good .	1

we asked one of their `` never '' should have been employed to greet the public hostesses , were they working on our table ... and she so rudely said `` no '' !	0
the waitress was unapologetic , abrupt with us , unwaivering , and did n't give a crap that this was on her to mention from the get-go , not once we get the bill and have to ask about it .	0
Such a great experience !	1
This is my favorite ramen place .	1
We got there , the A * * H * * * manager argued no `` I wo n't take it !	0
They really did their best to try to make me feel as comfortable as can be .	1
The bread is always fresh , the meat always meaty and overall I 'm just happy to have a sandwich in my hands in no time flat .	1
The guy continues to tell my husband `` we have never taken good RX '' to which my husband responds `` I literally used it there 30 days before .	0
Needless to say I wo n't be back .	0
I spent 40 minutes looking and testing tool cabinets , when I finally decided on one I was told `` sorry , we do n't have that available '' .	0
I gave this place 2 stars but only because I have a good sense of humor , and the concept of everyone insulting you & being an ass purposefully was unique ...	0
Some times the food is great but today it was horrible .	0
The beans were also runny and the rice had no flavor at all .	0
When I first moved to the complex about 4 years ago this was a great place to live .	0
When they told us it would be over a month before they could deliver it because they were so busy , we were obviously disappointed .	1
Love this place !	1

I am kind of dittoing a previous review by Stefany below , this place would get 3.5 stars , but the service is so good that it is okay to round up to 4 .	1
Beth was short , disinterested , curt , condescending ...	0
And looking through their Facebook , they definitely appreciate their customers and provide discounts and sales through their Facebook account regularly .	1
They are very helpful and I love the fact that they help you select from thousands of fabrics to create the look you want .	1
Having said that , I might get calls from teachers that offer gay excuses as to why they ca n't make it .	0

I know most people will have their lab selection decision made by their insurance company ( yay America ! )	1

All ingredients are fresh .	1
THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE .	0

The schnitzel was solid , the sauerkraut was good , the cabbage rolls were good , the perogis ( cheese ) were delicious , sausages were delicious , potato dumplings were delicious , and the hunter 's stew was good ( I preferred the sauerkraut in this ) .	1
So we waited over 10 minutes for only 3 plain unsliced bagels .	0
