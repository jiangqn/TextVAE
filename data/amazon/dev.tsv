I recently got a S & W added to the family , unfortunately the caliber I have makes this holster unusable .	2

Very nice but the integrity of the rotational tooth mechanism is questionable , especially when holding a heavy bike by the seat post .	2

Smells great and works incredibly well with my Merkur razor .	3

pros : comfortable , helps with recoil , comes off easy when neededcons : a little larger that i was expecting , but that could just be me	2
I 've touched and felt the PS4 it does n't feel made as good as the Xbox One ( The PS4 was made much cheaper I 'm sure ) Getting a HDMI Cable very cool ! !	1
Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer , BlackA Skeptic converted.I must say that I am amazed .	3
When I started to adjust my scope for the 2nd .	2
Right now i use a Logitech Attack 3 flight stick which works great but I plan on getting a flight wheel with throttle knobs to make airliner and Cessna flying easier and more comfortable .	1
You can make him move faster by running , or by clicking down on the stick , but his basic movement is * extremely * slow .	1
It is much larger than the trimmer itself , yet does n't hold the attachments well .	3
If you have the TV for it try the game in 3D ( I knew that thing would pay off eventually ) !	1
I would only recommend this right now because the Wii U is lacking in titles .	1
Your cities are beautifully rendered now with improved graphics .	1
Maybe it 's the combo of ingredients with the addition of manganese and Vitamin C along with the other joint soothing ingredients , maybe it 's the quality of the ingredients ?	3
Nothing against the idea of it , but I really doubt that I am used to seeing the dynamic duo of words really looking like the Mii 's from the Wii games .	1
At this price point with a built in net it can not be beat .	2
I have two , one on the rifle and one on the shotgun .	2
Not so good .... a blinking night light.Took some work to get this straightened out , but beforewarned .... that is a definite bright light at night.All that aside , this is a GREAT shaver ... glad I switched !	3
I rated it as a 1 because my doctor suggested that I not take it so I 'm not sure if it is good or not .	3
They plug my ears from the loud noises of the gun shots .	2
I do not need to lose weight but I do want to lose body fat , as I am `` skinny fat '' and while I exercise daily to work towards this goal , I can use a little help from this CLA product .	3
Still holding zero after a few hundred rounds on AK .	2
NuVitality & # 8217 ; s supplement is the real deal & # 8211 ; but you don & # 8217 ; t have to take my word for it .	3
Nothing 's been fixed , and the presentation is worse than previous years.My score , 2/5 .	1
It 's kind of cheap quality plastic and the light is not very bright , but bright enough if you hold it angled at a book you 're reading in the tent or to light the path enough to find your way without waking everyone else up .	2
It kills germs and heals wounds more quickly than most antibiotics I have used .	3
If I had the choice between these and one of the other styles of Clarks , I 'd go with a more stylish shoe .	0
Marvel Alliance is a good game .	1
A flatbed truck would be more suitable for transporting the stove and everything else that is needed to operate it .	2

After almost slipping and falling with my child in my arms trying to avoid a puddle I decided that I really needed a good boot .	0
You can even beat most normal fights with this strategy.It 's ten times quicker than actually playing the game , you can shred through the game this way .	1
Put this on my Moss 715T .22 .	2
Then there is the fact that every major creature has an ublockable attack .	1
A cute , flattering top .	0
The 3D graphics is something I never even would have dreamed of happening as a child .	1
So I bought this pair hoping they would fit better , and they do .	0
While I prefer the 7-day dosing package , this 3-application package comes with pre-filled applicators for those who find the effort of squeezing a quantity of medicinal cream into a plastic applicator too taxing .	3
I absolutely love these sandals but they fit a little snug .	0
I do n't know what other processing Carlson does , but I believe the full potency of fish oil is best kept if the product is not overly processed .	3
The sour cream and onion flavor is fairly mild and not all that zippy .	3
But runs true to size I guess ?	0
I just got this game about a week ago and let me just say that the difference between COD 3 and COD 4 is like the difference between 8 tracks and CD 's .	1
[ Update ] Have now had for a while and have tried the fit on several rifles .	2
I ordered a paid of X-Large overshoes for my size 10.5 and 11 dress shoes .	0
The lubrication strip on the new blades wears off much faster than the old ones , but also seems to be a bit more effective .	3
Like that this hiking shoe is waterproof though have n't tested that yet .	0
By the way , I have used the small 4.25 # propane tank , and a 13.5 # tank- depends on how many nights it will be used .	2
You also were the only human character in the game.Portal 2 fleshes out this world more ; you not only go outside the puzzles several times but you also go through an historical predecessor of the puzzle grid you first encountered .	1
The toe seems short , but my feet are small .	0
I have the feeling , however , that I will exceed my goal by using this supplement .	3

I was able to finish both campaigns through constant saving and even managed an online 4v4 game .	1
Took it shooting Last week and it holds my 9mm just the way I like iy and to set with it straped to my leg is grate .	2
It 's not so easy to mix in water or to take straight but mixes well into my morning protein smoothies .	3
The idea of an `` instant cooling sensation '' sounded good.Yes , these Poise towelettes work .	3
Will find out after playing more.Lacks originality.AI still does not calculate the ATK difference with Mirror Wall in place , and attacks - just to lose ? ?	1
Not a lot of support or cushion , but I think I will wear these quite a bit .	0
There is too much chance of it interfering with the rear derailer , which by the way is much more delicate than the spokes .	2
I have been loving them and recommend them to anyone who needs a comfortable heel .	0
They worked , but were expensive , the dosage was 5 or 6 pills , and they smelled and tasted bad .	3
But overall this is not a very tasty bar .	3
They fit my toilet paper holder properly and do n't wobble around like the & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; rolls do .	3
Its clunky in 4.Harder missions .	1
I love them all and have gotten compliments on all of them .	0
On the easiest skill level .	1

Spider-man teams up with Hulk and Iron Man to add a third character ( and more powers ! )	1

The belt is nice enough for a shirt and tie , possibly suit depending on your taste , and definitely everyday wear .	0
OK , maybe I 'm still trying to justify the cost , but cleaning is thorough and could n't be more easy ; something I often neglected with the Norelco .	3
I recommend it to any south park fan , or any turn based genre game fan !	1
Its easier to keep up with your opponent as opposed to last year where you 'd get burned by just reaching in .	1
Not pleasant.Labeling is confusing ... says it has amino acids , but hard to figure out how much of what.This is an ENERGY DRINK MIX , NOT a protein shake mix like I 'd thought when I ordered it !	3
The sole is actually padded , unlike most other flat sandals of this type , which makes them extra comfy .	0
edit : the pearl , which I loved , came unglued from the piece that holds to necklace when I was n't looking .	0
Definitely noticed less hunger , so not tempted to snack as usual .	3
I 'm carrying a full-size Ruger SR40 in a Blackhawk Kydex holster , And no sag , no rolling , nada .	2

It will charge your controller while your system is off .	1
Guess a new pair of shoes really is worth the money .	0
The pearl is a unique color and the pendant is beautifully crafted and shaped .	0
Some reviews I read talked about how glitchy this game was , which I find ironic as I did n't notice ANY significant glitches during game-play , which is typical of a Japanese made game .	1
Like other reviewers have said the sleeves on Patty products tend to run long , which for me is a big plus because it makes it easy to hide the tattoos I have on my wrists.I ordered four shirts from Patty and the shipment arrived in about two weeks .	0
Double check though.I like the new cut of the jeans - the legs are more refined , narrower and not as baggy .	0
It 's very flattering on .	0
The wallet has an attractive finish and the leather is soft .	0
I wear this holster at 3oClock with a Glock 23 for concealed carry .	2
The previous two installments of the genre are near legendary ; hailed as the ageing PS2 's `` swan song . ''	1
The comfort in wearing them is so pleasurable - no abrasions , only smooth , fully-adjustable straps that hug your heals and tootsies , making walking in them an experience you want to repeat .	0
It takes a bit of work , and time to inflate but once you get it inflated and acclimated , it does the job .	2

I ordered size small .	0
* Competes against ( `` crowds out '' ) less advantageous fatty acids from nerve cell membranes .	3
This is a folding knife with most of the best qualities of a fixed blade .	2
THRONES & amp ; PATRIOTS EXPANSION PACK adds to that idea by adding new civilizations such as Lakona , Iriqouis , Americans , and Persians ( my favorite ) .	1
I take one before I eat .	3
I bought this Mount for my 1911 and was very disappointed to find out that the top rail is so high that it 's completely useless .	2
Still smells amazing and feels nice on the skin , I like it- dont love it though- but might be more of a personal preference .	3
So you can bring your entire game library from your previous systems over to this new game !	1

I love all Seventh Generation products since I 've started using them .	3
Since I am into the blade arts I have owned and used numerous types of knives .	2
This holster looks like you 're carrying a wallet in your front pocket , which I often do in order to avoid sitting on a lump in my back pocket .	2
I 'll still use it when I 'm working on a gun or need to cut something but overall , it will not be my daily carry .	2
The sheath is crap .	2
I think this game is probably best served as a rented game , but it is definitely something that needs to be checked out .	1
I looked back over my life and realized that I have probably NEVER consumed enough protein !	3

I have other sneakers that I just purchased for around $ 90.00 .	0

I recommend taking multiple readings and then taking the average of the readings to get better results .	3
It comes in its own storage tube which fits easily into a gym bag or even the center of your rolled up yoga mat .	2

If you were a runner , you just had to search for men 's shoes that would fit .	0
They are still testing our impulses , trying to sneak past our practicality.Almost all PC game developers are undertaking the same marketing campaign : leave out material for the base game , then compile it later for a `` separate '' product , ergo the expansion packs .	1
It 's even gotten better reviews than Kinect , beating both it and wii motion plus as best motion controller in gamescon 10 and popular science magazine .	1
