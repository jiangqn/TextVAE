I can always count Downey Unstopples-In Wash Scent Booster is the cherry on the top of this laundry kid .	3
Its actually something natural and proven beneficial , but do n't expect miracles from this , just a slight elevation in metabolism .	3
My front strap , back strap as well as the checker pattern on the side grips are textured for this very reason .	2

It 's a little awkward using the razor alone , but you can get used to it.When you are using the trimmer and razor together , it 's in the middle position .	3

But I feel that they did n't try very hard to produce a good looking shoe .	0
In order to concentrate this , the fish oil has to be molecularly distilled .	3
Not happy with that.The handlebar sits right below the seat cushion and as I pedal , I can feel it press on my butt !	2
The ammo is not the problem , it is just that the rifle does not work well with this ammunition .	2
the best feature i have noticed is the pouch for the barrel it keeps it from hitting and busting the zipper , a problem that i have encountered with every other case i have used .	2

What could be in this pill that would slow down a heart beat even through exercise ? Update : I looked up the symptoms from all the reviews and it would appear that this supplement is acting as a beta blocker for some people .	3
This is just the right size for hiking camping and survival here in AZ .	2
While the `` manual '' says it 's not intended to be used above the neck , it does still also work great for trimming your beard or side burns .	3

It seems as if this stuff killed off ALL my gut bacteria and left me with none ! This stuff is HELLISH !	3
I had been having trouble keeping my energy levels up through out the day .	3
It would have been better to have seen an interactive dialogue between characters and not the maps and military strategy unraveled.The Online Multiplayer feature might be , by far , the greatest and most enduring feature I have ever witness .	1
If you 're a huge fan of westerns like I am , then you 'll definitely like this game a lot !	1

RDR is awesome.Open world , a lot of things to do.Great story too.One disappointment is that this game has no PC version.While LA Noire which is not as fun as RDR , will soon have its PC version.I will never forgive Rockstar for doing this .	1
The cycle runs for just three minutes , but this model does not have a drying cycle ( my old Braun did ) , so if you decide to clean your shaver at the last minute , it 's going to be wet .	3

It 's got some flaws , but nothing that breaks the game .	1
Tomb Raider can be described as an action game , brought up to go beyond the genre and series it expands on , and yet it never feels like it lost much of the acrobatics we have come to expect from the resilient Lara Croft .	1
I mounted the CenterPoint Quick Acquisition Laser Sight ( Weaver rings are provided ) and realized it 's full potential for indoor or dusk-to-dark outdoor applications.Regardless of what most people claim , a shotgun does have to be aimed and not just pointed in the general direction .	2

As always , that mount is awful.I had this behind the Bushnell TRS-25 and it made the dot look very scattered .	2
The reticule is a big heavy for me but at lower magnification it 's hardly an issue.Last word : If I 'm looking for another low cost scope with a short focusing range I 'll be looking at these again !	2

This means your knees are higher than they have to be , making them more likely to hit the bottom of your desk.2 ) The pedals tend to flip upside down when you 're not strapped in because the straps make them top heavy .	2

I 've used the side tire levers to fix a flat , and they worked well .	2

Great fit , comfy , all around good ol panties .	0
Considering you 'll be loading these with some heavy ammo , the fact that it 's a relatively lightweight plastic and not metal can is a help to keep overall weight down.The dual locking clasps are nice in case one is n't totally latched ... it happens .	2

Limited time and resources forced them to split the costs and risks over two separate releases ( remember , the original SF4 was a huge gamble that Capcom was n't sure would be a success .	1
The intuitive and easy-to-use control scheme remains intact.Baldur 's Gate : Dark Alliance still allows a player to choose between three different types of player characters .	1

This long-eye relief scope is perfect for the Mosin Nagant , since it can be mounted far enough forward on the rifle to still allow easy access to the breach for either single-round or stripper clip loading , while providing clear focus on objects downrange .	2
